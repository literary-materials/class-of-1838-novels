<!-- CHAPTER VI. --> 

<p>There is a certain point to which complacency and forbearance may go, but there is also a certain point at which they must infallibly stop; and when I awoke in the morning, and thought over the events of the preceding evening, and moreover found my poor Harriet extremely unwell, I fell to considering what course I could adopt to rescue her and myself from the unbearable thraldom in which we found ourselves, without offending Cuthbert, or, on the other hand, of evincing a proper sense of gratitude for the kindnesses he had lavished upon us.</p>

<p>I was perfectly satisfied of his entire unconsciousness that he was doing anything either to distress or inconvenience us; he felt convinced that we <i>must</i> like what <i>he</i> liked, or perhaps it would be nearer the truth to say, that he did not trouble himself to think much upon the subject. By this I do not mean that he was indifferent to our comfort or happiness, but that seeing the readiness with which all his wishes were complied with, and hearing neither remonstrance nor complaint, he was not aware that he was, in point of fact, making us positively miserable.</p>
    
<p>As the morning wore on, however, I began to think that my mind was likely to be occupied with even more important matters. Harriet’s indisposition increased, and I was informed about seven o’clock by the proper authorities that it would be advisable to call in medical aid. I immediately went to Harriet to inquire whether her disinclination to Sniggs continued as strong as ever, and in reply was referred to her mother, for whom she had sent.</p> 

<p>I knew exactly what the result of this reference would be. The prejudice entertained by Mrs. Wells against the unfortunate son of Galen, however natural, was unconquerably strong ; and as the tone of Harriet’s voice convinced me that in submitting the subject to her fond parent she would say nothing likely to remove or mitigate it, I determined at once to send off a servant to Dr. Downey, a lady’s doctor of considerable reputation and extensive practice, who lived within a very short distance of Winchester. Time it seemed would not allow of my sending to London for a Sir Charles or a Sir John, as I had, with a view to soothing poor Sniggs’s feelings, originally intended. I was, therefore, compelled to run the risk of offending him, hoping, however, in some degree to qualify what I knew would be considered a grievance, by getting leave to join him in the commission with the Doctor, who, in addition to his eminent professional qualities, was the very pink of politeness, and a universal favourite.</p>

<p>Finding that the proposed arrangement was agreeable to Harriet, I forthwith wrote to the Doctor and sent off my letter, and had the satisfaction of finding upon Mrs. Wells’s arrival that what I had done met with her entire approbation. From the moment, however, that the Doctor was sent for and my respected mother-in-law proceeded to her daughter’s room, I felt—certainly as I had never felt before— my anxiety had commenced—my worry had begun. I dreaded lest the Doctor should come too late—that some unforeseen accident might befall my beloved Harriet—I felt, in short, as if I had suddenly become a useless and superfluous member of my own family; I walked about the hall, went into one room, and then into another—stopped—listened—then sat down; until at length I resolved upon going into the grounds, and made a sort of business of looking at the celery and sea-kale in the kitchen garden. The kale covers might have been bee-hives, the celery trenches an asparagus-bed for all I cared, and into the house I came again, when to my horror I heard a sound certainly most unexpected by me at such a moment: that of the tuning of a fiddle in the drawing-room next to my wife’s bed-chamber. I hurried up-stairs astounded at such a circumstance, and there beheld Mr. Kittington, the dancing-master, just in the act of beginning the then popular country- dance of the “Opera Hat,” that being fixed upon for the first practice of the before-breakfast lesson to the young ladies.</p>

<p>When I entered the room the two pets, dressed with remarkably short petticoats and dirty white kid shoes, sprang forward to welcome me, and expected, I conclude, to see me look remarkably well pleased.</p>

<p>“My dear girls,” said I, “you cannot take your lesson here, nor, as I think, anywhere else this morning; Mrs. Gurney is extremely ill, and the noise will distract her.”</p>

<p>“Ill,” said Jane, “what’s the matter with her, uncle?”</p>

<p>“Jane,” said Kitty, “how <i>can</i> you be so foolish—she is not <i>very</i> ill, uncle?”</p>

<p>“Indeed she is,” said I.</p>

<p>“And so is Tom,” said Jane, “he is all out in a rash, and can’t see out of his eyes. Pappy is not up yet, but I’ll tell him as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said I, wondering at the sort of mind in which my Harriet and Mrs. Falwasser’s Tom could be by any means associated.</p>

<p>During this little colloquy, Mr. Kittington, in stockinet pantaloons and pumps—time half-past eight in the morning—stood fiddle in hand, naturally looking particularly awkward.</p>

<p>“I tell you what we can do,” said Kate, “we can go and take our lesson in the laundry, because I know it will vex Pappy if we lose it altogether.”</p>

<p>“It is,” said I, “indeed an essential point in your education.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Kate, “Mr. Kittington has had to come so early on purpose to give it us.”</p>

<p>“Do what you please, my love,” said I, “only I assure you Harriet is not well enough to bear the noise here.”</p> 

<p>I did this civilly and quietly, although I felt sick and wretched, because I did not like to allow the dancing-master to see that the domination of the Falwassers was so irksome to us as it really was, and because I did not wish the professor of the Terpsichorean art—or science—as the case may be, to think that I underrated either the importance of the study, or his own personal assiduity in giving his attendance; and so I conclude they <i>did</i> retire to the laundry, for I heard no more fiddling, nor did I see the young ladies, as it turned out, till a late period of the day.</p>
    
<p>I sent for Foxcroft, inquired how her mistress was, not daring to venture near the room myself. She told me that she was going on very well. This satisfied me; I did not quite understand what it meant; but the words “very well,” conveyed to my mind the intelligence generally which I wished to receive. I went to the breakfast-room; there everything was in order—comfortable and proper—just the same as if Harriet had been in perfect health. So it is if the master of a house dies—the whole establishment goes on seemingly of itself, for a week or two, without being in the slightest degree affected by his disappearance. This arises from the fact, that after all the discussions and dissertations upon feeling and gratitude and affection, and all the rest of it, in the relative position of servant and master, there is nothing in either death or destruction sufficiently strong to break in upon the routine of duty so long as it is paid for. The man who cleans the plate, cleans it as energetically, while the man whose plate it was three days before, lies upon tressels screwed up in his coffin, as he did that day week, when the defunct used his portion of it. Kittington, the dancing-master, in his stockinets and pumps, would just as enthusiastically have taught my half or three-quarter nieces (whichever they are) to jump and wriggle and twist, to the tune of the “Opera Hat,” if Harriet had been lying dead in the next room, instead of being only seriously indisposed: and so it is in all callings and professions. Hamlet, we all know, asks Horatio, speaking of the grave-digger—</p>

<div><p>“Hath this fellow no feeling in his trade ?”</p></div> 
    
<p>And as Shakspeare shows in every line he has written the most perfect knowledge of human nature that man without inspiration—was it with-out?—ever possessed, it may be thought absurd to say one syllable more upon the subject, except that although still young I have lived long enough to observe, that so far from a man <i>not</i> having a feeling in his business, it is completely the reverse; his feeling in his business is so strong, that it supersedes any feeling towards any trade except his own. Send for your carpenter, bid him put you up some fifty yards of treillage whereupon you wish your jessamines and honeysuckles to twine, or over which you propose your clustering ivy to creep; <i>his</i> point is the treillage, and in order that lie may make what he thinks a workman-like job of the treillage, half your jessamines and honeysuckles and two-thirds of your ivy are destroyed. To him follows the painter, who cares as little for the carpenter as he does for the remnant of your shrubs and climbers; <i>he</i>, only desirous of setting himself off as an artist in <i>his</i> way, not only paints the treillage, but covers with his <i>invisible</i> green—<i>visible</i> to the naked eye—the stems, branches, and leaves of every one of the pet plants, which unconsciously conniving at your scheme of screening, are good enough to intertwine themselves in your treillage. The bricklayer heedlessly annihilates the efforts of the painter, in making <i>his</i> work strong and good which is to support the superstructure; and the plumber, who comes to consolidate certain corners and crannies, completes the job by sending his Etna-like rivers of boiling lead over the roots of the unhappy specimens for which all the pains have been taken and all the pence expended.</p>
    
<p>I remember hearing Mathews, who, as the reader knows, was my first enticer to dramatic writing, tell a story of a man who had made, with exquisite neatness and beauty, so far as the word is applicable to such a subject, a Hessian boot, the height of which did not exceed three or four inches, but the sole and body of which presented as beautiful a specimen of workmanship as ever was seen. Mathews was delighted with the ingenuity and skill displayed in the construction of this little <i>bijou</i> and offered to buy it. The artist declined selling it. Matliews then proposed that he should let him have a repetition of it. The difference between a repetition and a copy has been established by Lawrence and other illustrious painters. “No, Sir,” said the man, “I would do anything for <i>you</i> that I could do for anybody, but I made that little boot in a moment of enthusiasm, and I feel confident that I never could make another like it.”</p>

<p>This is a proof that a man may be really enthusiastic, and have the powerful “feeling of his business,” which I contend generally exists, and which ought always to exist to ensure success; and I say so, not only upon Dr. Johnson’s principle, that, whatever is worth doing, is worth doing well, but because I am certain that, unless a man believe the particular pursuit in which he is engaged, let it be what it may, to be vitally important to society at large, he never will be anything in the craft or trade which he may have adopted.</p>

<p>I have spoken of one actor—whose whole heart and mind are occupied in his profession, Mathews—and not only are his heart and mind engaged in it, as the “means whereby he doth sustain his house;” but they are more honourably and more enthusiastically involved in an anxiety to uphold the character of the profession which he so brightly adorns. Terry—a man of great reading—of powerful intellect—and of high available talent—has but recently come amongst us; but if I prophecy aright, Terry will never attain his just rank as an actor. The reason is plain; he treats his art as a trade, and feels always disposed to laugh at himself, even when he is on the edge of a great performance. If he take a fancy to a part, he will act it, <i>con amore</i>, but only as a joke; and although still new to the London boards, it is clear to me that his perception of the ridiculous, makes him sneer at the success which his not half-developed powers procure him: so, as I have already said, it is with all men; and as a proof how far the “enthusiasm of the moment” will carry me, I will write down here, that which, as
I never read what I write, and as my papers are not intended for the public eye, or public criticism, it does not much matter if I have written down before, a dialogue I once overheard between two scavengers at the corner of Spring-gardens.</p>

<p>They were sweeping up the mud, and spooning it into a cart with an almost inevitable certainty of <i>Shrapnelizing</i> the “passing villagers,” when in a pause from their labours, one, <i>he</i> with the shovel, said to the other, “I say. Bill, what’s gone with Jim, I han’t seen him about a long time?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say,” said Broom; “I guess as how som’think’s happened to him unforseen.”</p>

<p>“He was a good un,” said Scoop.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he of the besom, “he was a smartish chap at a crossing, or anything straight forward; but as for a bit of fancy work, sweeping round a post, or anything o’ that sort, he hadn’t no kind of taste whatsumever.”</p>

<p>If I am inadvertently repeating myself, I cannot help it; the dialogue seems wonderfully well calculated to exhibit</p>
<!-- The following quote is centered and in slightly smaller text -->
<div><p>“A ruling passion, strong in mud.”</p></div>

<p>And still better to prove the justice of my original aphorism, that, without enthusiasm, all labour is in vain.</p>

<p>When the young ladies, who seemed entirely to sympathise with the dancing master as to the importance of the lesson, had flitted to the laundry as a fit scene of action, I waited impatiently for—what I could hardly define. Cuthbert at length got up, was dressed, and, as usual, wheeled in to breakfast, but Mrs. Brandyball pleaded headache, I have every just reason for thinking sincerely, and did not make her appearance; Cuthbert and I were therefore <i>tête-à-tête</i> at the morning’s repast.</p>

<p>“Poor Tommy,” said Cuthbert, “is—ah, dear—very unwell; he came to see me while Hutton was getting me up; he is all over red spots,—I must send for Sniggs after breakfast.”</p>

<p>Now, of all things in the world that I did not desire, or rather of all things in the world I particularly wished to avoid, was a visit from Sniggs in the course of this morning. I knew him so well, and was so perfectly aware of the activity of his interference, that I was convinced neither solicitation nor remonstrance would prevent his making his way to poor Harriet, whose very safety might depend upon her not being excited, as I knew she would be by his appearance in her room, the moment he heard she was unwell.</p> 

<p>“I think,” said I, “as I expect Dr. Downey here in an hour or two, it would be no bad thing to let <i>him</i> see Tom.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Cuthbert,” so he may; but then I asked Sniggs to come here to-day to play chess, and it is only his coming a little earlier, and then he can see Harriet, and so, because the physician, whatever you call him, may not be here in time—eh—it is as well, as Mrs. Brandyball says, to have two strings to one’s bow—eh?”</p>

<p>All these arrangements of Cuthbert’s were made, as usual, unconsciously, as if expressly for the subversion of all my prudential plans of operation; and yet I did not see how I could counteract their effect; for if I confided to him Harriet’s disinclination for Sniggs, the first thing Cuthbert would most assuredly do, would be to tell him the whole story the moment he arrived, and thus make an enemy, even if he were yet friendly, of the peripatetic reporter of Blissfold.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Cuthbert, “have you formed any plans with regard to the young stranger?”</p>

<p>“What,” said I, “the child unborn !”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cuthbert, “I am to be god-father; and you shall find, my dear Gilbert, that I do not consider the obligations of such a connection merely nominal. If it is a boy, let him have a profession—make him a lawyer—or—eh—perhaps that will be too fatiguing,—and if it is a girl”——</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks for all your kindnesses,” said I; “but let us secure the treasure, before we discuss how to dispose of it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like foresight,” said Cuthbert; “I am sorry for poor Tommy—I—hadn’t Hutton better step to Sniggs’s?”</p>

<p>The kindness which mingled with my brother’s anxiety to upset my schemes was so remarkable, and so genuine, that I did not know how to thwart him in his wishes, and was on the point of ringing for his man, when the sound of wheels caught my ear. I turned to the window, and saw, to my delight and surprise, the great object of my present solicitude. Dr. Downey’s carriage rapidly approaching the house.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the Doctor,” said I; “we need not send for Sniggs; he shall see Tom before he goes up-stairs.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Cuthbert, looking quite satisfied, “that will do nicely.”</p>

<p>I hastened to the hall to welcome the physician, whose early appearance was very agreeably accounted for by the fact, that my servant on horseback had overtaken him about four miles from Ashmead, as he was returning from a visit of a similar nature to that which he immediately turned his horses’ heads to pay to Harriet.</p> 

<p>I presented the Doctor to my brother, and then went up-stairs to apprise Mrs. Wells of his arrival. Cuthbert, who thought of nothing but Tommy and his rash, began immediately to open his case to the Doctor, who, not being the least aware that there was a second patient to attend to, was mystified in a great degree by Cuthbert, who, in consequence of what I had said with respect to Downey’s seeing the boy before he visited Harriet, thought that I had left the room to fetch him for inspection.</p>

<p>“I always say,” said Cuthbert, “that prevention is better than cure, and that the earlier anything of this sort—eh, is looked after, the better.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Sir,” said the Doctor, gracefully bowing his well-powdered head, “nothing is wiser than precaution.”</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly understand the cause of the complaint,” said Cuthbert; “but I dare say you will be able to tell when you see the patient.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the Doctor, with a look which implied some little doubt of Cuthbert’s state of mind, “yes, I”——</p>

<p>“I think it may proceed from cold,” said Cuthbert; “being out at night will do it sometimes—letting off squibs and fireworks—silly thing—poor dear, nearly lost an eye already, poor thing.”</p>

<p>The Doctor pushed back his chair, and stuck the poker into the fire.</p> 

<p>“Yes, Sir,” said he, “very likely.”</p>

<p>“Great romps overheat themselves,” said Cuthbert; “my two daughters are never half careful enough in that respect; I am often afraid that something of the same sort will happen to <i>them</i>.”</p>
    
<p>“Oh,” said Downey, walking towards the window, “yes. Sir, as you said just now, caution is wisdom.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cuthbert, delighted with the urbane manner in which the physician humoured him, “and especially about <i>their</i> age, poor things, before they have done growing.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Sir,” said Downey, “quite—perfectly, nothing can be more judicious. Does Mr. Gurney expect me to follow him ?”</p> 

<p>“No, no,” said Cuthbert, “he is gone to fetch your patient—probably dirty hands want washing,—hair to be combed, or something of that sort,—wicked little thing, and as full of mischief as possible.”</p>

<p>What farther might have been said to illuminate the physician, had the dialogue lasted any longer, it is impossible to surmise. Certes, my friend Downey’s eyes greeted me with a look of infinite satisfaction as I made my appearance.</p>

<p>“Well, Gilbert,” said Cuthbert, “where’s Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said I, “I quite forgot, I will ring for Hutton to fetch him.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were gone on purpose,” said Cuthbert, “else I could have rung myself, or, at all events, have requested the Doctor to do so for me.”</p>

<p>“May I presume to ask,” said the Doctor, “who Tommy is?”</p>

<p>“A son-in-law of my brother’s,” said I, “who feels unwell, and whom my brother wishes you to see.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the Doctor, “I understand—I did not at first see:” saying which, he with- drew the poker from the fire, and laid it on the fender.</p>

<p>Hutton obeyed the summons, received his orders, and in a few minutes returned with Master Tommy, whose appearance was by no means prepossessing.</p>

<p>“Come here, Tommy, my dear,” said Cuthbert; “let this gentleman look at you.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t,” said Tom. “I wont be physicked—not for nobody;—the pimples is come hout, and they may go hin agin for all I care, only they hitches like winkin.”</p>
    
<p>“My dear Sir,” said Dr. Downey, “there is no question about the young gentleman,—a clear case of small-pox.”</p>

<p>“Small-pox, Sir!” said Cuthbert; “I never had it, Sir. I shall die of it. Tommy, my love, go to the other end of the room. Gilbert, open the window,—ring for Hutton,—get me some eau de luce and water,—camphor.—Oh !—you really don’t mean it?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed, Sir,” said the Doctor. “I am happy to say that the character of the eruption at present appears favourable; attention and care will most probably get him well through it, I have no doubt: it is of the distinct kind, and of course less serious than the confluent. I will write a prescription for him before I go up stairs ; he had better be put to bed, and of course his diet is to be of the most sparing character.”</p>

<p>“I won’t be starved,” said Tommy; “and I won’t go to bed, and I won’t take no physic.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, my dear, you will, I am sure,” said the Physician. “Your health requires it; you would be in great danger if you did not do as we tell you, and perhaps would die.”</p>

<p>“Then I should be poked into the pit-hole,” said Tommy. “I’ll jump out of bed the minute I’m put in. I’ll eat whatever I can; and as for the physic, see if I don’t shy it all under the grate.”</p>

<p>“No you won’t, my dear,” said Cuthbert. “Hutton,—Doctor, if you don’t want to examine him any more,—Hutton, put down the eau de luce, aqd take Master Tommy away,—there’s a dear.”</p>

<p>“I will ask him a few questions, with your permission,” said Dr. Downey; “but we can go into another room.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t tell for nothing,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“If you please. Sir,” said Foxcroft, rushing into the room very pale, “Mrs. Wells wants the Doctor,—my mistress——”</p> 

<p>“What!” said I, “here, Tom, the Doctor shall see you by-and-by. Now, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Doctor,” screamed poor Cuthbert at the top of his voice, “what’s to be done for <i>me</i>? I shall catch this infernal disorder.”</p>

<p>“What disorder?” cried Mrs. Brandyball, who came sailing into the room. “What disorder?”</p>

<p>“The small-pox, Ma’am,” said Cuthbert. “I never had it.”</p>

<p>“Small-pox!” screamed the lady. “Nor I, Mr. Gurney,” and forthwith she fell into hysterics.</p>

<p>Such a scene never had I witnessed. Tom roaring,—Foxcroft crying,—Mrs. Brandyball hooting,—Cuthbert groaning,—the dogs barking,—two canary-birds singing as loud as they possibly could,—Hutton scolding the dogs,—I hustling the Doctor out of the room,—and Kitty and Jane scudding across the hall to take leave of Mr. Kittington, the dancing-master.</p>

<p>I led the Doctor up to my wife’s room, and having just looked in, Mrs. Wells held up her hand to caution me against speaking. I heard a faint murmur of complaint from my beloved wife,—the door was shut upon me,—and I burst into tears. I did,—and I am not ashamed to record the fact.</p>

<p>Oh, the thrilling, aching, throbbing pain of anxiety which seemed to affect every part of my body and limbs; my hands were icy cold, my tongue was parched, my knees trembled; my kind, my affectionate, my darling Harriet was in pain and in sorrow, and I unable either to assist her or soothe her in her sufferings. I did not know how to dispose of myself; return to the breakfast parlour I could not; where I was, I dared not stop, lest I should hear the sound of Harriet’s voice in grief and anguish. I went down stairs, I fled to my sanctum, and shut myself in my library, to pray for the safety and restoration of the being I loved best on earth.</p>

<p>Silence had been restored, and I heard nothing where I sat, except the subdued ringing of the servants’ dinner-bell, which told me that I had been for upwards of two hours in my concealment; presently, however, I was bunted out: Hutton knocked at the door, and after repeating the operation twice, I felt obliged to answer, to prevent a continuation of his thumping,—my brother wanted me.</p>

<p>I of course obeyed the summons; and there I found Cutbbert covered with a shawl and a blanket, extended on the sofa, with the three windows of the room all open.</p>

<p>“What a thing to have happened!” said Cuthbert; “it is,—dear me,—what shall we do?—poor dear Mrs. Brandyball never had it,—nor either of the girls. I have sent for Sniggs,—they have shut themselves up in Kitty’s room with camphor bags and eau de Cologne till he comes. They are all going to be vaccinated,—so am I,—and Hutton and I have been speaking to Mrs. Habijam, and the coachman, and the two housemaids, and they have all agreed, and I want you to let Foxcroft be vaccinated, too,—— there’s nothing like precaution.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear brother,” said I, “all these people have had either the small-pox or been vaccinated before, rely upon it.” </p>

<p>“Ah, but,” said Cuthbert, “the cow-pox is like everything else, it wears out; besides, it was not discovered when I was born, nor when you were born. I don’t recollect having had the small-pox, nor do either of my girls.”</p>

<p>“Probably not,” said I; “and probably none of the establishment recollect a similar event in any of their lives, inasmuch as it generally occurs at a period to which the memory of man reacheth not.”</p>

<p>“Well, it can do no harm,” said Cuthbert; “let Sniggs see poor Tommy as soon as he comes, and then have him well fumigated,—ah,—or washed,—anything you think safest,—and then let bim begin his operations. I’ll have poor Pilly vaccinated, too.”</p>

<p>“Who?” said I.”</p>

<p>Pilgarlick,” said Cuthbert, looking the picture of despair.</p>
    
<p>“What, your tom-cat!” exclaimed I.</p>

<p>“I think it will be safest,” sighed he. Hutton paused in his operation of bathing his master’s temples, to see whether he were pleased to be facetious, or was in sober earnest. I am convinced it was the purest bit of matter-of-fact solicitude that ever man expressed.</p>

<p>The arrival of Sniggs was the signal for action. I was ordered to convey him to Tom’s apartment, in order to satisfy Cuthbert as to the reality of the existence of the disease he so much dreaded; and accordingly I conveyed him to the room where Tom had compounded with himself as to not going to bed, by having taken off his jacket and waistcoat, and lain down on the quilt with his boots on, ready for a start whenever he felt disposed to run riot.</p>

<p>“There,” said I to the apothecary, ” there’s a patient for you. What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“Hold up, Master Tom,” said Sniggs; “look to the light—eh,—umph,—feel any itching?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Umph,—I see,” said Sniggs; “obstructed perspiration,—a sort of nettle-rash,—better out than in,—little cooling physic will set all to rights.” </p>

<p>“Why,” said I, ” we were thinking it was the small-pox.”</p>

<p>“The small-pox, my dear Mr. Gurney!” said Sniggs; “not a bit of it. Where’s the synocha,—where the languor and drowsiness which invariably characterize that complaint? No, no; the blood wants cooling. I’ll send him something which will set him all to rights in no time.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “but do <i>you</i> know we generally believe it to be the small-pox.”</p>
    
<p>“Ha, ha!” said Sniggs, “that’s deuced good; who is likely to know best?”</p>

<p>“My brother says it is small-pox,” said I.”</p>

<p>Oh, very likely,” said Sniggs.</p>
    
<p>“Mrs. Brandy ball says so,” continued I; “so does the housekeeper, and——”</p>

<p>“My dear Sir,” said Sniggs, “these are all very respectable people in their way, but wholly incapable of distinguishing the difference between the most dangerous case of variola confluens and the simplest effect of febris urticata.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, rather worried at being pooh-poohed in so decided a manner, “Dr. Downey, who is here, says it is the small-pox.”</p>

<p>“The deuce he does!” said Sniggs. “Dr. Downey here,—is he?—umph,—that’s Mrs. Wells’s doing,—never mind,—does <i>he</i> say it is the small-pox?—Hold up your face again, Master Tom. Small-pox, eh?” Sniggs rubbed the boy’s forehead, and looked very wise. ” Dr. Downey says it <i>is</i> small-pox;—put out your tongue, Master Tom.—So,—by Jove, it is small- pox, sure enough;—never like to create unnecessary alarm,—umph,—very odd. Oh! yes, yes,—that’s small-pox,—not the least doubt of it,—never can mistake <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>The suddenness of Sniggs’s conviction with regard to Tom’s disorder would have affected me more perhaps than it actually did, if I had not recollected that a much more eminent man did precisely the same thing when one of the Princes of the Blood caught, in mature age, and for the second time, the measles. Upon that occasion his Royal Highness having ascertained from two of the most eminent physicians of the day the real nature of his complaint, subsequently sent for his facetious body-physician, who, like Sniggs in the present instance, most strenuously denied the least resemblance between measles and his Royal Highness’s rash, until, being informed that Baillie and Heberden had both decided that measles was the complaint—like Sniggs, the worthy doctor looked again, and decided that measles it was.</p>

<p>Having now received the authentication of all our worst fears, I proceeded to Cuthbert, having previously informed our apothecary of his extreme desire to have every living inhabitant of the house vaccinated, and of his anxious wish for his complete purification, previous to his visit. Sniggs, delighted with the idea of having anything to do, seemed smoothed at once, and smothered the angry feeling which I saw rankling with regard to Dr. Downey’s visit; however, I was <i>à l’abri</i>, for he laid the whole scheme at my poor dear mother-in-law’s door, and believing in the proverb which makes the mother say—”</p>

<p>imputed to her influence over Harriet his very disagreeable exclusion from the honour of ushering the heir or heiress of Ashmead, as the case might be, into this world of trouble. So far I got offscot free, and I was not sorry for it; because, as poor Mrs. Wells had long before rendered herself obnoxious to what Lieutenant Merman used to call Snigg’s “sculduddery,” a little more of his ire could do <i>her</i> no harm, and I might escape unscathed.</p>

<p>In the hall we encountered Mrs. Habijam, who appeared entirely lost in a dread of the consequences of the infection; she intreated Sniggs to make all the haste he could to his own house, to procure a sufficient supply of what she called the “various ” matter; in short, I never saw a panic so general or so serious. I congratulated myself however on having escaped Mrs. Brandyball and the young ladies, whose appearance would have detained me from fresh inquiries about Harriet.</p>

<p>All I heard was that everything was going on extremely well, and that Doctor Downey wished to know when luncheon would be ready; this was music to my ears—he could not care about luncheon if everything was <i>not</i> going on extremely well, and I felt delighted in having the opportunity, under such circumstances, of talking to the man to whose skill and judgment I was to be indebted, under Providence, for the safety of my dearest love.</p>
    
<p>Luncheon was ready, but Cuthberthad retired to his own room. The exertion of being very much frightened had been more than he could bear; besides, as he was resolved to be the first person in the family vaccinated, he determined, like Caesar, to die with decency, and accordingly betook himself to his bed in order to catch the gentle infection from the lancet of our Lampedo.</p>
    
<p>“Well, my dear Sir,” said the Doctor, “we are all doing as well as possible; the sweetness of our dear patient’s temper cannot fail to be in the highest degree beneficial to her during her illness. I think I never saw such mildness and amiability. Great care must be taken about the young gentleman’s small-pox. I trust we shall have one child in the family, in an hour or two, about whose having been vaccinated or not there can be no question; and upon that account I should say the lad ought to be removed while he is yet able to bear it.”</p>

<p>“But whither is he to go?” said I; “and will his affectionate father-in-law suffer him to be separated from him?”</p>

<p>“I am, of course, not competent to answer either of those questions,” said the Doctor; “but I only do my duty in apprising you of the danger to be apprehended to the infant by his remaining here, and having communication with those who are also in the habit of going into Mrs. Gurney’s room.”</p>

<p>“What can I do?” said I; ” my brother is actually in bed; he, I am sure, will neither let Tom go without him, nor with him—in the one case he would apprehend the worst consequences to the boy, and in the other the most dreadful results to himself.”</p>

<p>“I merely speak professionally, Mr. Gurney,” said the Doctor, “and not with any view of interfering with your domestic arrangements; but were I to remain silent upon the subject, I feel I should incur a very serious responsibility.”</p>

<p>It struck me that perhaps Sniggs would allow Tom to be removed to his house, whither perhaps my brother might be induced to let him go, with the satisfactory conviction that he would be constantly under the superintendence of the medical man in whom, spite of my mother-in-law’s prejudices, he had an exceedingly high opinion. I mentioned this expedient to the Doctor, who, being acquainted with Sniggs only by name, and totally ignorant of the terms upon which he lived with our family, hesitated—as he generally did—to give any decided opinion upon its probable success. I resolved, at all events, to mention it to Cuthbert, before Sniggs’s re-appearance at Ashmead. I did so, and found him by no means disposed to expose his darling lad to the difficulties of a removal, or the inconveniences of a strange house.”</p>

<p>No,” said Cuthbert, “<i>I</i> had better go—Mrs. Brandyball would like to take the two girls—you know they were going on Tuesday—so—I think, after I have undergone the operation, I will try to be got up, and go with the girls and their governess to Bath—eh, dear!—what a terrific idea!—how dreadful a circumstance!—however, we must make three days of it—it must be nearly a hundred miles from this to Bath.”</p>
    
<p>“Yes, my dear Cuthbert,” said I; “but however this plan may secure <i>you</i> and the girls from danger, and however happy we should be to pay every attention to Tom in your absence, it leaves poor Harriet and her child exposed to extreme peril.”</p>
    
<p>“I have ordered Hutton to sprinkle vinegar all over the house,” said Cuthbert, “and to fumigate the passage down stairs with gun-powder.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied I; “I can vouch for his activity too: I never smelt anything so horrible in my life.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Cuthbert, “never mind smells—dear, dear—isn’t it dreadful?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, seeing that I had no chance of succeeding alone in obtaining an order of removal for Master Tom, “I will go back to Doctor Downey, and the moment Sniggs comes he shall be sent to you.”</p>

<p>Sniggs did come—I presented him to the physician, and felt at once pleased and perplexed by finding his opinion with regard to the removal of Master Falwasser entirely agree with that of the Doctor. Sniggs was essentially good-natured, extremely fond of meddling, delighted to be “doing,” and excessively anxious to show the “public ” of Blissfold that he stood exceedingly well with the family at Ashmead, in spite of Mrs. Gurney having, under her mother’s in- fluence, called in other medical aid ; and he—as it were intuitively—started the very proposition which I was about to make.</p>

<p>“Why not take Master Tom to my house?” said Sniggs; “I shall have him there under my own eye. Mrs. Sniggs will be as careful of him as if he were our own. All difficulty will be removed, and I shall be too happy to be of any use in relieving you from your difficulties.”</p>
    
<p>“Have you any objection to open the business to my brother?” said I.</p>

<p>“Not the least,” replied the apothecary. “That he ought to be moved from this house nobody can doubt; he can be removed at present without danger—where can he go better than to the house of a medical practitioner, in whom, as I flatter myself, his father-in-law has so much confidence? I’ll go this instant—give my opinion and advice—vaccinate my patient, and then make every necessary arrangement.”</p>

<p>The natural readiness for action which uniformly characterized the proceedings of Mr. Sniggs, blended with the prospect of the profits arising from his successful attendance upon the darling lout, filled him with energy and eloquence. What he said or what he did in the way of persuasion to my brother, I do not pretend to guess. All I know is, that in less than half an hour the operator returned to the dinner-room, where Downey and I were sitting, and with sparkling eyes and a joyous countenance announced the consent of Cuthbert to the arrangement, provided the Doctor would give a favourable opinion as to the safety of the young patient’s transport from one place to the other.</p>

<p>Our difficulties now were nearly overcome—we were sure of the Doctor’s voice in our favour, and a few minutes more sufficed for the arrangement of the whole affair. I confess I felt myself relieved of a heavy burthen, and not a little anxious to see the project carried into execution. Having got so far, I ventured to suggest to Cuthbert that there would in that case be no necessity for his leaving us; but Hutton’s entrance into the room to mention that one of the house-maids, he was afraid, was sickening, set all doubt upon that question at rest; in fact, as it appeared to me, the preparations for the joint departure of Mrs. Brandyball, the girls, and Cuthbert were already far advanced, and that a regular communication had been kept up between the high contracting powers, who for their own separate and particular reasons had resolved upon leaving Ashmead immediately, and leaving it together.</p>

<p>The girls were tired of us already, and as the mirthful noises and romps, in which they much rejoiced, would be of a necessity suspended for the next two or three weeks, they anticipated more of dulness and quietude during the rest of their stay than suited their tastes and genius; and this, added to the necessity of Mrs. Brandyball’s return to her seminary by a particular day, concluded that faction in their resolve to decamp, having first undergone the preservative and pre- ventive process which was to be universally inflicted by the skilful hand of Sniggs.</p>

<p>With respect to Cuthbert, kind as his professions were, and liberal as his conduct might be, I could not help observing an increase of that indifference towards Harriet which I had previously noticed in a slighter degree. Kitty’s private consultations and conversations with her father-in-law struck me to be somehow connected with this disagreeable change. And I could not help fancying that his invincible desire to leave Ashmead was in some degree attributable to the same influence. What I feared was that the influence— powerful as it most unquestionably was—was not spontaneously exerted. I was alarmed lest its operations should be di- rected by the more matured judgment of Mrs. Brandyball. What her objects were I could not exactly define; but I felt convinced that she had some point of first-rate importance to herself to carry, and I could not divest myself of the idea that she made Kitty the tool with which she might carry on her machinations.</p>
    
<p>To be candid, however, as one may be, at least when he writes for no eye but his own, I did not regret, in this particular instance, the success of the young lady’s persuasiveness. To put Cuthbert to any inconvenience would have given me the greatest pain and uneasiness, but he preferred leaving me—so far I had nothing to reproach myself with; and as for the removal of the rest of the party, nothing could be more agreeable. Accordingly, I submitted to his expressed will. Less than two hours were allowed for the packing of the carriage in which the travellers were to make their journey. Four horses were ordered to be at the door at half-past three, by which arrangement it was proposed that the party should reach Salisbury by seven or eight o’clock, where they were to sleep, Hutton and Cuthbert’s other servant, with their luggage, filling Mrs. Brandyball’s post-chaise, and bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>It was determined, moreover, that Tom should not be apprized of any of these arrangements, inasmuch as, if he had even quietly acquiesced in them, there must have been a parting, which would have defeated the main object of the flight. Sniggs therefore undertook to amuse the lad by performing various tricks of magic and conjuration in his room while my guests were getting under way.</p>

<p>Dr. Downey had resumed his close attendance upon my wife, whose side her affectionate mother had never once left since she came to her in the morning. Wells and Bessy had come over from the Rectory, and were just in time to take leave of the travellers; and within a few minutes of the proposed time, I received the parting kisses of Kitty and Jane, handed Mrs. Brandy ball into the carriage, and shook hands with Cuthbert, feeling, I can scarcely tell why, a presentiment that I never should see him at Ashmead again. He seemed to me to have thrown himself—or rather, passively to have fallen—into the hands of strangers; and when he bid me farewell, he did not make the faintest allusion to Harriet, or express the slightest wish to hear the result of her confinement.</p>

<p>The subsequent scene with Tom was very remarkable. Sniggs having made himself excessively entertaining, suggested to Tom that if he liked to come to his house, to dine and sleep, while there was so much bustle going on at Ashmead, it would do him no harm, and that there was no objection to his doing so. Tom jumped at the proposal: and Sniggs having taken the proper opportunity of sending for a hack chaise from the inn, charitably preferring the risk of infecting a public carriage, into which fifty strangers might in the next day or two be buttoned, to using any vehicle belonging to the family, wrapped the hopeful youth up in a great coat and a cloak, and carried him off unresistingly to his residence in the High-street of Blissfold; nor was it until the next morning that Master Tom clearly understood the character of his visit there; he was then enlightened by the enforcement of the severe discipline which had at first been ordered, and clearly comprehended that he had been sent away from home on purpose to be out of the way. The rage and passion of the young gentleman exceeded all bounds, and it required main force and the intervention of a strong lock to keep him where he was. At length, however, as the disorder advanced, his spirit sank, and he continued to take the medicines which were prescribed, and not take the food which was proscribed, with a sulky sullenness which, if not more amiable, was at least more endurable than his violence.</p>

<p>At half-past seven o’clock on the evening of the departure of the amiable family and their charming friend, I became the father of a fine boy, pronounced by Mrs. Wells and the nurse to be as like me as possible. The Doctor looked pleased, and congratulating me with the greatest warmth, announced <i>that</i> which was the welcomest part of his important intelligence, that the mother and child were “as well as could be expected.” </p>

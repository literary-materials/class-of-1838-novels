<!-- Chapter title: STORY OF THE POOR SOLDIER. -->

<p>George Mortlock was the only son of his mother,
a respectable widow, who lived upon a small income,
which the industry of her late husband, and her own
savings, had procured her. Her son was a well-disposed lad, but unthinking. His mother wished him
to follow in the footsteps of his father, and do well
as an honest shoe-maker; but George not being
partial to a sedentary life, took it into his head one
morning to receive his majesty’s bounty, and enlist
as a private in a marching regiment. This event
grieved the widow Mortlock exceedingly; for she
was very fond of her son. But she was not a selfish
character, and therefore, though it pained her much
to part with her dear son, she was willing at the
same time that he should please himself; “As long
as he is happy,” she said to herself, “I shall be so
also.”</p>

<p>Many of her friends and relations told her that her son would inevitably be ruined in the army, that
the life of a soldier was immoral, and in short, that
the army was a reprobate profession.</p>

<p>“If so,” said Mrs. Mortlock, “that must be the
fault of the individual, and not of the profession.
There are good and bad people in all trades, and I
find there is no respect of persons nor professions
with God, but whoever seeks his protection will
find it.”</p>

<p>“But my good old woman,” said one of her
friends, “your son will see every thing that is bad
among the soldiers of his regiment, and no doubt
will in time get into their ways.”</p>

<p>“If he do,” said the mother, “that will be his
own fault. For my own part, I cannot conceive
any profession to be inimical to a Christian life.
My son has been taught the difference between good
and evil, and if he choose the latter in preference to
the former, the fault will again be his own. But I
have far better hopes of my George. The temptation to follow the example of others may be strong; but the principles he has imbibed will, I trust, be
stronger; so that, instead of being turned from the
rectitude of his ways, it is possible that he may be
enabled to turn many of the unthinking men of his
regiment into the right path.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, George Mortlock joined his
regiment, and in the course of a few months, it was
sent abroad on active service. When he went to
take leave of his mother before he embarked, he said, “There are two things, my dear mother, which
I want you to give me.”</p>

<p>“And both you shall have, my beloved and darling boy, if in my power,” said she, falling on her
son’s neck and pressing him to her bosom. “Say,
what are they?”</p>

<p>“Your blessing, and your Bible, my mother.”</p>

<p>“And both you shall have with my whole heart.
And in return, I have two things to ask of you.
Never be a single day without appearing in the
presence of your heavenly King, and never on any
occasion be ashamed to show your allegiance to
Him. You were his soldier, before you were his
majesty’s; and to Him, your <i>first</i> and chief services
are due.”</p>

<p>The day after George Mortlock took leave of his
mother, the regiment he belonged to embarked on
board a transport, which was so crowded, as to
threaten all on board with suffocation. The regiment, however, arrived in safety at its destined port,
and was quartered in a most beautiful and romantic
village, at the distance of only a few miles from the
place of debarkation.</p>

<p>There George Mortlock was amply compensated
for the hardships he had undergone during the
voyage thither. The salubrity of the climate, the
cheapness and abundance of provisions, the profusion of the choicest fruits, good nature of the inhabitants, and novelty of the scene, all conspired to
make the spot a perfect paradise. The orange and citron-groves of the valley, and vineyards teeming
with clustering grapes, were cheering objects to
men, who had, during a long voyage, lived upon
salt provisions. All nature appeared in this beautiful spot as if made for delight. And to men long
hemmed up within the narrow limits allotted them
on ship-board, it seemed like a purer region.
George Mortlock’s heart glowed with rapture and
with gratitude. He saw the God of Nature in his
works, and blessed the goodness which had preserved him during a long and perilous voyage, and
brought him to such a paradise of delights. “How
am I to show my gratitude to God for all the
favours he has bestowed upon me?” said George
Mortlock to himself. “I can do nothing for God.
He wants nothing from his creatures, for all they
have are his. But,” again said George Mortlock to
himself, “though I can give God nothing but my
<i>heart,</i> yet I can please him by performing offices of
kindness to all his creatures. Every opportunity
we have of showing kindness to our fellow-creatures,
gives us at the same time the means of testifying
our love towards our God.” George Mortlock panted
for opportunities of testifying his gratitude to his
God and Saviour; and he knew that it was only
by exhibiting his love to the creature, that he could
manifest his regard and reverence for his Creator.
The poor soldier determined, therefore, to treat every
man as a brother, and every woman as a sister, and
on all occasions to try to do as he would be done by. In the salubrious climate above mentioned,
George Mortlock’s regiment remained two years,
during which time he passed through the grade of
corporal, and was promoted to the rank of serjeant.
These advantages were procured him by his sobriety,
and exemplary conduct. He was not only sober
and orderly himself, but he endeavoured to make
his comrades equally so, and had the good fortune
to succeed, by reclaiming a very great number of
the soldiers. At the expiration of a few years, the
regiment took the field, a battle ensued, in which
George Mortlock behaved so gallantly, that he was
complimented by his commanding officer, and recommended by him for promotion: and a vacancy
in the regiment taking place soon after, Serjeant
Mortlock was promoted to the rank of ensign, received as a member of the mess, and welcomed
there by every officer in the regiment.</p>

<p>Thus, in every rank and situation in life, it is in
a man’s own power to make himself be respected.
George Mortlock, the officer, was the self-same man
as George Mortlock the private. It was by his
good conduct that he had been elevated, and by his
good conduct he preserved the respect and love of
his brother officers and privates of the regiment;
and we might here apply to him the lines of
Pope—</p>

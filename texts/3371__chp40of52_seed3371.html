<div><p>“Red o’er the forest peers the setting sun,<br>
The line of yellow light dies fast away<br>
That crown’d the eastern copse; and chill, and dun<br>
Falls on the moor the brief November day.<br>
Now the tired hunter winds a parting note,<br>
And Boho bids good-night from every glade;<br>
Yet wait awhile, and see the calm leaves float<br>
Each to his parent-rest beneath the shade.”<br>
The Christian Year.</p></div> 

<p>The rich sunsets, the varied foliage, the gorgeous dahlias, the late peaches, and the clustering grapes of October, had yielded to the dull fogs, the leafless branches, the drizzling rain, and the outward and inward gloom of the succeeding month.</p>

<p>Henry Fitzherbert, sick at heart and jaded in body and mind, had returned from his hasty and vain pursuit of the St. Clairs, to hurry to Oxford, and take his degree there with all speed, that he might immediately after obtain permission from his uncle to make the tour of Europe; in the course of which he doubted not that he should find out their retreat.</p>

<p>Emily was still in town, under the care of her kind and learned physician; a considerable amendment had taken place in her health, though she was still delicate even to weakness.</p>

<p>Lady Wilson, scarcely to be recognised as poor plain Anne, so much had sea-air, ease, indulgence, every advantage of toilette, and that greatest of beautifiers happiness done for her, was staying with Sir James at his delightful villa at Twickenham; affairs of importance preventing his taking her to his seat in the north.</p> 

<p>Emily found her society an actual blessing, and with Miss Matthews had accepted an invitation to pass a fortnight with her.</p>

<p>After they had been domesticated there for a few days, Miss Matthews one morning, just after the post came in, approached Emily, and with an agitation she sought to conceal, told her that private affairs called her away for a week, and that she trusted Emily would remain where she was till her return.</p>

<p>Emily kindly hoped no bad news had reached her, and assented.</p>
  
<p>Now the letter Miss Matthews had received was from Shuffle: it informed her that Sir Herbert lay to all appearance at the point of death, his will as yet unsigned. He urged her immediate presence at the Abbey, and enforced the necessity of silence to his nephew and niece until all was over, when a hasty summons could be despatched to them.</p>

<p>It was with a trembling, guilty joy that Miss Matthews beheld the approaching <i>dénouement</i> of the plot at which she had so long worked in true mole-like fashion. The signal failure of many direct attacks had convinced her long ago that of becoming Lady Fitzherbert she had not the remotest chance; but her close intimacy with the plotting and daring Shuffle had Opened to her a new field for manoeuvring, a new method by which she might yet hope to become the actual mistress of Cleveland Abbey.</p>
  
<p> A week glided by, and at its conclusion Miss Matthews came in a post-chaise, accompanied by Shuffle, to inform Miss Harland that she had heard that Sir Herbert was dangerously ill, while she was staying with some friends in the neighbourhood of Cleveland Abbey.</p>
  
<p>These friends were in reality Mr. and Mrs. George Shuffle. Mr. George Shuffle was Sir Herbert’s medical attendant, and nephew to the lawyer of that name. There Mrs. Sullivan also was staying, to be in readiness if needed. Miss Matthews did not state who her friends were, but she mentioned having met with Mrs. Sullivan, and said, that hearing of Sir Herbert’s dangerous illness, and being too much agitated to go to him alone, dear Lady Wilson’s mamma had kindly accompanied her. She said she had found him in such a state, that she had resolved immediately to come and fetch Miss Harland; that she had written to Mr. Fitzherbert, and had availed herself of the escort of Mr. Shuffle, as her feelings were so overcome that she feared to travel alone.</p>

<p>Emily, who loved her uncle as well as it was possible to love one so little known to her, and who felt deeply grateful to him for the benefits he had lavished on her, was awfully and inexpressibly shocked. She had never, since she could remember, lost a friend; she had never come in actual contact with death; and the idea of it filled her with a thrilling horror. She was in a fever to be gone, and half maddened by the delays which Miss Matthews, with all her boasted grief and cambrickhandkerchiefs, contrived to effect under the pretence of hysterics, swoons, and nervous attacks on the road.</p>

<p>Now, in truth, Miss Matthews and Shuffle had left Sir Herbert after his will was signed, and when it seemed apparent to all, and by the medical man was pronounced certain, that he could not live through the night.</p>

<p><i>They</i> were therefore fully prepared to see the Abbey windows closed as they drew near, and to hear Mrs. Comfit’s mournful announcement at the gates, that it was all over. To Emily, whose fears had latterly been less vivid than her hopes, the shock was so great and unexpected, that she sank back in the carriage in a swoon so deep, that for some time all believed that her gentle spirit had actually passed away.</p>

<p>It was while they were endeavouring to recover her, that Henry galloped furiously through the park, his steed splashed and reeking, himself pale with anxiety and intense fatigue, for the summons had found him just released from the schools: tears, manly tears, rose in his eyes as he marked the closed shutters and death-like stillness which announced that the long-suffering spirit of the recluse had at length found rest.</p>

<p>After seeing Emily in some degree reviving, though still unconscious, he stole to the rooms of the deceased, those rooms erst so carefully closed against him:—now, who should oppose his entrance?</p> 

<p>The body was “laid out,” as it is called, as old women lay out the dead, that is to say, the limbs were straightened, the feet turned up, the fine forehead and classical head enveloped in an odious cotton night-cap, (such as he had never worn,) the jaws were bound up, and, as if to add horrors to the awful spectacle, two crown pieces had been placed on the eyelids to weigh them down, giving a ghastly glare to the face.</p>

<p>Henry gently removed them, and gazed with deep and genuine regret on the altered features of one, who, if he had noticed him little, had ever been substantially kind to him; one who was mingled with all his recollections; one whom he now thought he had too often slighted, whose solitude he now fancied he might have cheered; one, in short, invested with the magic charm the heart flings round the unreturning, unredeemable, unoffending dead.</p>

<p>The face looked much older than when in life; older! it appeared actually aged. Yet the expression was calm; the hair, much more grey than when Henry saw it last, was long and spoke of neglect; the thin primrose hands were trained by his side, and on the third finger of the left was a mysterious ring, containing only two initials; a ring Henry remembered all his life, and which in boyhood he had furtively and often endeavoured to decipher. The hand was stretched defenceless before him now ; and he nervously shrouded his eyes, afraid of unravelling the mystery, and feeling as though it would be sacrilege to gaze on the secret of the dead; for worlds he would not have read those letters.</p>

<p>He knelt in awe and sadness by his uncle’s corpse, and the prayer, which reason may condemn, but which the heart will prompt, the prayer for the peace of the departed soul, the doom of which angels could not alter, for has not the Unchanging, the Omnipotent pronounced it? —rose to his lips almost unconsciously.</p>

<p>As he imprinted a last and reverential kiss on the cold stiff hand, he was startled by a light step and a soft sigh, and Emily sank on her knees by his side.</p>

<p>Emily! oh, as he gazed on that wan and pale cheek, and marked that almost shadowy form, the startling transparency of the hands she raised in silent prayer, how acute was the anguish, the self-reproach of his spirit! how he loathed his deception and himself!</p>

<p>Fearing for her the sight of her uncle’s altered features, he gently drew the linen cloth over the face.</p>

<p>“Henry,” she said, in a low hollow voice, without looking up, “I must see him, indeed I must.”</p>

<p>He hesitated for one moment, and he removed the cloth; but the first meeting face to face with death, the awful change, the crowd of recollections, the tide of gratitude and regret, the fear, the horror, and at length the intense sorrow, the maddening anguish connected with the first idea of the grave, the death-worm, the eternal separation, wrought so powerfully upon her weakened mind, that a fit of violent hysterics ensued, and Henry, lifting her light and faded form in his arms, carried her from the painful scene.</p>

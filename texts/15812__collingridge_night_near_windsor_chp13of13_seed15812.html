Everybody doeth, what everybody does—that which<br>
they ought not to do.”

<p>His dreams, like the productions from the
pens of many modern writers, were a mingled
yarn of truth and fiction—love and war—gentle peace and ruthless vengeance. But Lavin’s
sleep was feverish and uneasy; and the captain of the steam-boat accidentally fetching
way up against the table, he awoke.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sir:”—said the man—
“but the water makes the footing here so
greasy—”</p>

<p>“This your jacket?” asked Lavin, without,
however, moving his head off it.</p>

<p>“No, sir, it’s not mine.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was, because there was a letter
directed to you in it.”</p>

<p>“Not to me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Your name’s Morten ?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not Morten. That’s the skipper
of that ‘ere brig ; and this is his jacket, too, I
think; for he was supping here with me in
his shirt sleeves just afore you boarded us in
the smoke.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s a letter of Bartwell’s, by the
crest.”—said Lavin starting up, and seizing
the handle of the fork.</p>

<p>“It’s a letter of nobody’s, now.”—remarked
the other, as the saturated epistle dissolved in
pieces immediately on being touched.</p>

<p>“It may be better to be lucky than rich;
but it’s d—-nation to be neither.”—muttered
Lavin, beginning on the principle of shutting
the stable door after the horse is stolen, to rifle
the pockets of Captain Morten’s garment.</p>

<p>A handful of tin tacks, a bunch of keys, a
penknife, and a pocket-book, were the sum
total of the spoils collected. The first and
second articles were useful enough in their
way; but the blades of the third were broken
or blunted; and the fourth—beyond a pencilled diary of the worthy commander’s avocations, such as, for six days out of seven, “at dock,” “at dock;” while the variations on Sundays might be comprised in, “got drunk,”
“got jolly drunk,” “got jolly <i>well</i> drunk”—
contained nothing to repay the trouble of unclasping it; or to implicate his employers, and
lead to the detection of the system under
which the nefarious traffic was, and still is,
carried on by the House in question, to the
great pecuniary advantage of the Firm.</p>

<p>Lavin went on deck, and the change in the
scene, a few hours had wrought, was wonderful.
The wind had fallen to a seven or eight knot
breeze, and the swell was going down, while
the dark tan sails of the fishing boats that
were standing out to sea were mellowed by
the beams of an unclouded, but watery sun.
Except the Guardship, nothing remained at
anchor in the downs. The Gull was crowded
with the canvass of vessels beating up, or
steering to the southward with stu’nsails low
and aloft both sides. The Diamond, meanwhile, had been kept before the wind under
every stitch that could be set; but, though
the higher light-house on the South Foreland
was just beginning to open to the left of the
lower one, Blackie in vain swept the horizon
for the square-headed topsails of the Mohawk, for she was speeding on her course from Dungeness to Beachy Head.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon Blackie and Lavin
had exchanged the accommodations of the
steamer at sea, for those of the Ship at Dover;
and a fair excuse for a good dinner was all the
benefit the two adventurers reaped. Success
makes all the difference; and the commander,
who, besides his merits as an officer and a
seaman, had little to recommend him, got a
rap over the knuckles from the Powers that
be. But the Service has luckily so many good
officers, that it can well afford to lose a few ;
and when he quitted it in disgust, his place, in
one respect at least, was not long empty,* as
the Admiralty were at no difficulty to fill it up.</p>

<!-- horizontal line at page-turn; below it reads: "* Persian saying." in smaller font, associated with the starred phrase "not long empty" -->  

<p>For one sailor that is met with in the play
world, ten soldiers are a short proportion; and
gambling will always be a taste more peculiarly
indigenous to the army than the navy: but the
very spirit of enterprise and perseverance—
the very habits of activity, and the constant
weight of responsibility, that render further
excitement superfluous during professional employment, form, if directed that way during a
period of listless idleness, the most essential
attributes in the character of a betting man.
Blackie and Lavin now entered into a sort of
partnership—one bringing with him the knowledge of business; and the other, the needful
to carry it on.</p>

<p>Lord William, when he first heard of his
favorite’s return to the subscription-room near
H. P. C., shook his head; but when Lavin
had picked up a few loose hundreds, and
acquired a character for judgment as well as
punctuality, old Eustern <i>shook his hand</i>.</p>

<p>As for the sin of the thing, whether in
reality it be much or little, any or none, the
world, with its usual servile eye aloft, decrees
</p>
<!-- quote is centered to the left and in smaller font -->
<div>
	<p>“What in the captain’s but a choleric oath,<br>
Is in the soldier blasphemy;”</p>
</div>
<p>
and a rich man has long been licensed to do as
he likes—a poor man never. And, as it cannot be denied but that Lavin acted as much
from necessity as choice, in justice to him be
it said, that his reputation for honor was unsullied. He was daily getting in deeper with
a “certain set;” but you yet were safe with
him; and he was received at houses, to which the <i>entrée</i> was of itself sufficient guarantee :
though how much longer he was thus to play
with mud, and keep clean hands, comes not
within our province to decide.</p>

<p>Constance sorrowed in secret over the ruinous career in which he had undisguisedly embarked; and Lavin’s feelings were not of the
most enviable order—unless the hectic pink
that coloured his haggard countenance, the
down look, and the tremulous falter of his
voice, whenever they encountered each other
in society were to be considered symptomatic
of pleasurable emotion. She knew that she
retained much of the influence over him she
once enjoyed; and she knew that a tithe of it
would have been sufficient for the purpose.
His passions were sobered down:—and one
word from her—</p>

<p>But pride prevented her from speaking it;
and over the block of pride much happiness
has stumbled, and more is yet to fall.</p>

<hr>

<p>The “day of the Derby,” in the May of the
year ensuing from the commencement of this
narrative, was one of those rare ones whereon
the weather was fine, and the favorite won.
Lavin had made his book up upon the field;
and it was plain, that he had yet some years of
apprenticeship to serve before acquiring the
art of mastering his countenance; for as he
rode up to Lord William’s phæton, and coldly
lifting his hat to Constance, made some casual
remark in connexion with the horses, Eustern
whispered an inquiry, whether he had been let
in.</p>

<p>“Serve you right—serve you right”—continued Eustern, on being informed that it was
to a pretty considerable amount.</p>

<p>“There’s the Oaks between this and settling
day.”—said Lavin brightening up, while the
laugh of mischief was embodied in every
feature; and Lord William turned pale, as he
‘ thought on the morrow :’ for to those who
have made the intricate anomalies of human
character their study, it will hardly call for
comment that a man, who had had his debts
of honor paid once by his family, should, for
the reparation of his dilapidated fortunes,
secretly resort to the self-same means he so
strongly reprobated in another.</p>

<p>Lavin was engaged to dinner at the house
of a friend at Sutton; and except that he
showed an utter <i>sansouciance</i> about his losses,
and refused to back a mare, he owned with
Blackie, and had entered for the next day’s
race, against another mare which stood equally
low on the list, there was nothing one way or
other to attract remark. But the following
morning, when he dropped in late to breakfast,
his horse was heated and as ragged as if it
had never been in the stable all night; while he
himself looked jaded, and there was a restless
flutter in his manner that did not pass unobserved.</p>

<p>“He’s off his feed;”—said one—“but others
besides him have laid their money out, and lost
it too. It’s never any use fretting; and I was
on the downs at four this morning ”—he
added, by way of apology for his repeated
attacks upon a pigeon pie. But, like the story
of the Prince who posed his tutor—when the
latter was expatiating on the advantages of
early rising; and to enhance its merits, told
him that a man, who got up soon one morning, found a purse—by retorting, that the
unfortunate fellow who lost it must have been
up still sooner, Lavin had been deprived of appetite on precisely the same ground that
his friend had gained it, by being there before
him.</p>

<p>Nine hours back, when the downs were
quiet—when the gambling booths were closed,
to complete their preparations for the next
day’s campaign—when the embers of the
gipsy fires were smouldering into cold grey
ashes, and the vagrant hordes, gorged with
plunder, and enriched with the spoil of fools,
were dreaming of new lies beneath the hedgerows, a horseman rode stealthily around the
course, pausing at intervals to listen. But
none besides himself were stirring; and even
the distant baying of the watch-dog at the
moon was unanswered by the mongrel curs
that guarded the entrance of the blanket
tents. A light glanced across the upper casements of a small public house, about a stone’s
throw from the stewards’ stand, and the rider
reined sharply up within the limits of a broad
shadow cast upon the turf. The figure of a
man was at the window, but soon disappeared.
The light followed; and, letting down the
last chain, the other galloped into a hollow,
and trotted out again in a straight line for the point where the cross road traverses the broad
way from Tattenham’s corner, home; when
he turned in and spurred on for the distance-post.</p>

<p>The French expression of <i>ventre à terre</i> affords a better notion of the racing stride than
any word in our language; and the phrase
was never more applicable, than it was to the
pace of two horses which swept past him like
a meteor. Both were full of running. But
what they were, or which was best, boots
little here to say: only Lavin’s reply at breakfast, when bantered about being out of conceit
with his mare, was, that he and his partner
had been at Epsom all the morning taking all
they could get ; and the odds against the
Kitten were somewhere about sixteen to one.</p>

<p>There is many a true word spoken in jest.
Lavin was not among the crowd that thronged
as usual to the Warren to see the horses
stripped; but his nervous impatience at the
delay of each false start was so uncontrollable,
that many ladies quite “compassionated that
young man.”</p>

<p>When the race began, it was evidently between the favorite and his mare. But the former was struggling; and the Kitten pressing hard upon her quarter, and pulling all the
way. When called on by a gentleman, the
solitary occupant of a plain dark curricle, stationed at the least frequented side of the
course, she drew up without an effort—went
by—and won in a canter; leaving the losers
to console themselves, by designating it a
bite, and pronouncing her, notwithstanding
the injury they had sustained, a very harmless
horse.</p>

<p>Lord William’s head collapsed upon his
niece’s breast—and a faint groan is said, by
the bystanders, to have escaped his lips.</p>

<p>The ring may be, for aught we know, still
rife with the Kitten’s run. Vague rumours are
extant in Tircrilt, of a titled son of Erin, who
lingers out at a foreign court the remnant of
his days, an insolvent violator of the laws of
play—at Almack’s, of a girl of fashion, who
died near Naples of a broken heart.</p>

<hr>

<p>“And Lavin —” I exclaimed: for I must
confess to have felt a deeper interest in this, than the preceding tale, which wearied and
revolted me.</p>

<p>—“And Lavin was a ‘rich,” but, like
the merchant in the ‘Legende of London,’
all who knew him best, knew he <i>was not</i> a
HAPPY man. Nor are there wanting those
who, when his constant alternations of unnatural levity and desponding gloom are made
the theme, point to their foreheads and foretel
his end.”</p>

<hr>

<p>THE END.</p>

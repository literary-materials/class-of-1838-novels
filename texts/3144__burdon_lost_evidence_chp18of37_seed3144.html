<p>
But he that doth a noble nature show,<br>
Obliging others, still does higher grow;<br>
For virtue practised euch a habit gives<br>
That, among men, he like an angel lives.<br>
The humble man, when he receives a wrong,<br>
Refers revenge to whom it doth belong,<br>
Nor sees he reason why he should engage,<br>
Or vex his spirit, for another’s rage.<br>
Waller</p>.

<p>Great was the anxiety of Milborne, as he approached
the cottage of Ailsey Gleghorn, lest the persuasions of Samuel might have failed to induce Mr. Ogle to proceed thither for the
night; and convinced that, for that gentleman’s advantage, it was absolutely necessary to remove the terror and mistrust he well knew he unjustly entertained of himself, he was eager to assure him as speedily as possible of his fidelity, and restore confidence between them, lest, by his impetuosity and rash confidence in Dacres, all chance of establishing his innocence might be for ever annihilated.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, he thought it not improbable that Mr. Ogle might still be astir, and though, when he reached the hovel, the closed shutter prevented his observing what was passing within, the hum of voices convinced him he was not mistaken. With the delicacy of a feeling heart, he shrunk from intruding abruptly on the privacy of the unfortunate gentleman, and, knocking softly at the door, it was almost immediately opened by Samuel.</p>
<p>“Who is there?” at the same instant demanded Ogle, who was pacing the hovel with hurried strides.</p>
<p>“Milborne, sir,” returned the old man, as soon as he recognized the priest,” he craves to speak with you.”</p>
<p>“What sends him here?” cried his master in an angry tone—”is he not contented with blasting the peace—the hopes—the reputation of my life, but he must needs witness the ruin he has made?”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Mr. Ogle,” said Milborne, advancing within the threshold—</p>
<p>“Out of my sight! begone, if you have an atom of humanity!” exclaimed the gentleman, as he held his hand before his eyes; “begone, if you would not madden me with the remem
brance of the countless horrors that form and name bring thronging on my sight.”</p>
<p>“I have ventured to come, sir,” continued the priest, in a voice tremulous with the emotion which the spectacle of one he once had known noble alike in person and in mind, excited in his heart, but ere he could find words to proceed. Ogle withdrew his fingers from his eyes, darted at him a glance of fury, and, stamping his foot on the ground exclaimed, “What, still there? basilisk as thou art, if thy eye could kill as it
can wither, thou wert welcome. Hence from my sight—begone ere my poor wits forget, all patience and forbearance.”</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Ogle—hence I cannot go till you have heard what I would say,” replied the minister, with the tranquil firmness of one whose purpose was not to be shaken.</p>
<p>“Ha! have you come to sell your evidence, or are your facts too weak to bring me to the gallows, and you would glean some damning information, from the loose raving of my over
wrought brain?”</p>
<p>“Neither, Mr. Ogle,”—he placidly replied: “whatever chance placed it in my power to attest against you, I have never yet given you reason to think that I would use that knowledge
to your injury. Rather than be compelled to do so, I have been an exile for years.”</p>
<p>“Ha! does he speak the truth ?” demanded Ogle, hastily turning towards Samuel.</p>
<p>“He doth indeed, sir,” answered the old man, “and, if you ask me, I can only say I don’t believe you have a better friend within the four seas.”</p>
<p>“What brings you here?” inquired Ogle abruptly of the priest, though, ere he had ceased speaking, he averted his eyes from his face, as if it was an object too painful to look upon.</p>
<p>“I have much to say, sir, concerning your interest,” he replied in an agitated voice; “but it will little avail unless you give me your confidence, as well as your attention. My dear master,” he continued, whilst he sank on his knee at the feet of the gentleman, and endeavoured to take his hand, “you have not forgotten my early service, you have not for gotten the days of our childhood, you cannot have forgotten—and oh, by all your kindness to your faithful servant—and by the love you once believed I bore you, I do intreat you to esteem me honest! I do intreat you to put away the vain shadows of mistrust from between us, and let me serve you, as I crave to do—with heart and life.”</p>
<p>“Milborne, is it possible?” murmured his master, who after vainly endeavouring to release his hand from the grasp of his foster brother, now yielded it unresistingly.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is possible,” returned the priest, protestations.
whilst tears almost choked his utterance—”every thing is possible.”</p>
<p>“All but my acquittal,” replied Ogle in a voice of the deepest, the most heart-rending, desolation.</p>
<p>“Yes, even that is possible, by God’s assistance,” returned his companion.</p>
<p>“Milborne, beware!” cried the gentleman, starting suddenly from him, “take heed how you awake false hopes in my excited mind, for,
though I’ve borne disgrace till it has grown by use part of my being, this wasted form and yet more feeble brain could not again sustain the agony they once endured, before despair had taught them to be calm.”</p>
<p>“Yet you are innocent?” eagerly rejoined his listener.</p>
<p>“Ay, as the soul before it animates man’s feeble clay,” exclaimed Ogle; “by all my hopes of heaven, I swear the stain of blood was never on these hands.”</p>
<p>Milborne gazed on his master’s mournful countenance as, with deep solemnity, he raised his arms towards heaven, whilst he uttered these words, with a delight surpassing that of the proudest conquerer in the hour of his triumph, when the wreath of glory yet blooms upon his brow, and the shouts of applauding multitudes ring loudly in his ear; gladly would he again have undergone all his tedious years of banishment for the enjoyment of that moment; and, no longer doubting that he should ultimately succeed in proving the innocence of Ogle, which it had ever been his only pleasure, amidst the troubles of his wayward life, to imagine, he sprang from his feet, and, clasping his hands with holy fervour, exclaimed, “Thank heaven that I have lived unto this hour, and hear me now take all things sacred to witness that henceforth I devote my time—my faculties—my life, to prove your innocence of the foul charge, and bring the real criminal to light.”</p>
<p>“Alas, Milborne,” said his master, greatly moved; “it may not be ! for me there is no balm in Gilead, no gleam of sunshine on this side the grave, and 1 have learnt to think almost with apathy that brief will be the space ere death will close my weary pilgrimage of shame and sorrow. Yet my child, Milborne—my child—I would not that her gentle heart should ever hear the story of my guilt, which, when I’m gone, malicious tongues will take delight to tell her! it would be her death.”</p>
<p>“My dear master,” returned the priest, “I trust you will live for years to behold her happiness; but I deny not that, like your own peace of mind, it will henceforth depend on the entire and public disproval of every accusation which has been attached to your name.”</p>
<p>“Ha, wherefore think you thus?” demanded Ogle, eagerly.</p>
<p>“Her heart is Mr. Witherington’s,” briefly replied the minister.</p>
<p>“Alas, I feared it would be thus,” returned the gentleman; must then my existence shed a curse over the only thing I love? must the fate to which I have been so long a victim blight with its malignant influence all her young affections? How know you this?” he added, turning abruptly to his companion, as if he fain would doubt the truth of his intelligence.</p>
<p>“I travelled with them from Flanders,” said Milborne calmly.</p>
<p>“And he?”</p>
<p>“Lives only for your daughter.”</p>
<p>“His love is honourable ?” demanded the anxious father.</p>
<p>“It is a feeling worthy of your daughter and himself,” returned the priest.</p>
<p>“Knows he her real name?”</p>
<p>“He suspected it long, and now no longer doubts it.”</p>
<p>“And loves her still? no that may not be,” rejoined Ogle; “for, were I such as he and all men think me, ‘twere vile—base—cowardly—nay, most unnatural for him to love my child—the child of him who shed his father’s blood.”</p>
<p>“He loved before he knew it,” answered Milborne; “and, on the bare suspicion, he wrestled strongly with the passion his words
had not betrayed.”</p>
<p>“Answer me truly!” said Ogle trembling from head to foot; “hath he told Edith of this slander?”</p>
<p>“No, not one word!”</p>
<p>“Thank heaven! and doth my sister know her consanguinity?”</p>
<p>“She hath never even suspected it.”</p>
<p>“‘Tis well—’tis well!” murmured Ogle, and he turned away with a deep sigh, as if a heavy load had been removed from his breast: ” my sweet child,” he continued: “it is well thy poor mother did not live to see thee, as I have done, return unto thine own land, beneath the very roof of thy kindred, despised, disgraced,
and slandered, the jest of troopers o’er their evening ale. I would have slain the lying scoundrels but for thee, Milborne, or forced them on their knees to swear my Edith spotless. To-morrow—ay, to morrow, I shall see thee, my child—hear thy sweet voice, and feel thy bright smile animate my withered heart—my girl—my only treasure!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Witherington has promised to bring her unobserved from the castle soon after dawn,” said the priest; “and from the woods
I will conduct her hither.”</p>
<p>“Secrecy is unnecessary,” said the gentleman coldly, “for Lord Dacres must speedily be informed of my arrival.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Mr. Ogle,” returned Melborne; “but my exertions in your behalf would be hopeless, unless your arrival in England is
kept a secret even from him.”</p>
<p>“What, from my only friend?”</p>
<p>“Whoever are the guilty, they are doubtless your enemies,” returned Milborne; “and secrets have light wings.”</p>
<p>From Leonard Dacres I can have nothing to apprehend,” said the gentleman with much warmth; ” he hath been true when all the world forsook me; and learn, if you knew it not before,” he continued with increasing agitation, “it was he who, by large bribes, purchased the silence of his servant—Robert
Forster—who found my scarf dabbled in blood,—enough—enough. I cannot now repeat the frightful tale.”</p>
<p>“I know it all,” returned the priest; “all but its truth. Forster is dead.”</p>
<p>“Ha, dead! and hath absolved me not?”</p>
<p>“I was not at his death-bed,” said Milborne; “but, if he made confession, time may yet reveal his disclosures.”</p>
<p>“Time cannot wring secrets from the grave.” replied Ogle mournfully; “it cannot revive my buried happiness, nor change the ways of destiny.”</p>
<p>“My dear master,” said Milborne, with deep solemnity; “the events of time are in the hands of the Lord, and, though he alone can bless the result of our labours, it is man’s duty
to prepare and act.”</p>
<p>“Ay, when he hath power,” returned the misguided man; “but I am shackled, bound hand and foot by the same evil destiny that blasts my life.”</p>
<p>“Then trust to my exertions,” cried the priest eagerly; “I do not ask your assistance in the plan I shall pursue—nothing but silence and secrecy, and with that request no fate
forbids you to comply.”</p>
<p>“You speak like one who hath some ground on which to build his hopes,” said Ogle regarding the animated countenance of his companion for the first time with a searching eye.</p>
<p>“I would not have mocked you with my proffers of service, if I had no clue to direct their exertion,” replied the priest.</p>
<p>“What do I hear,” exclaimed his listener; ” where—how have you discovered it? But no—no—it can but be delusion; the mystery which wraps the secrets of that day is too subtly woven to leave a hope that the skill of man can ever unravel it.”</p>
<p>“It is not quite impossible,” answered Milborne, “as I might now have proved to you, but for a series of accidents alike unforeseen and unavoidable.”</p>
<p>“Fate! fate! did I not tell you so?” cried Ogle, with almost a triumphant expression, and he shook his head incredulously and turned away.</p>
<p>“Then we must oppose prudence to its influence,” said his companion calmly; “and therefore, my dear master, grant the single request I make, and keep your arrival secret. You have enemies, and you cannot doubt that there lives one whose very existence depends on your bearing the stigma of his crime.”</p>
<p>“My life is not worth purchasing by deceit,” was the gentleman’s reply.</p>
<p>“But your daughter, Mr. Ogle,” said Milborne; “you cannot be indifferent to her happiness or her welfare, and both may be endangered by unnecessary disclosures.”</p>
<p>“Well— well, be it as you please,” replied the gentleman, more moved than he chose to confess; “but you surely cannot require that when my daughter has rejoined me we should
continue in this desolate hovel?”</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Ogle, surely not,” answered his companion: “there is a farm-house upon your lands on the banks of the river Blythe, not more than five miles hence, where the tenant
is devoted to your interest, and you may be most secretly, yet conveniently, lodged.”</p>
<p>“We’ll speak of that to-morrow; it is already late, and, see, old Samuel has set us a good example,” said Mr. Ogle, turning towards a heap of hether in the corner of the cottage, on which the faithful creature, completely exhausted by his late fatigues, lay snoring most musically. “Good night, my friend,” he added, extending his hand to the priest, “if you are deceiving me, the guilt be upon your own conscience; the evil you can work to me will little add to the burden of my afflictions.”</p>
<p>Milborne pressed the hand that was thus given him in silence, for, well aware of the sincerity of his attachment to the unfortunate gentleman, his full heart disdained all further professions; and, deeply moved, he turned away and lay down to repose by the side of the unscious Samuel.</p>
<p>A small rude bedstead in another corner was left for Ogle’s use, and even his countless causes for anxiety were ere long absorbed in the oblivion of a dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>Milborne was disturbed at the first peep of dawn by his landlady, old Ailsey Gleghorn, shaking him with no gentle hand, and demanding, in an angry whisper, what fellows he had dared to bring under her roof in the dead of the night; and with some difficulty he prevented her arousing the sleepers by assuring her they were honest men and true, who would pay her handsomely for their lodging. The old woman shook her head, muttering that honest men had little need to skulk in such beggarly hovels, and she laughed outright when Milborne requested her to pay them all the respect in her power. It was a bitter laugh, as of one who respected nothing either human or divine, but though the priest liked not its tone, he trusted that a piece of gold, for which he knew her fondness, might soften the anger she expressed at having her poverty exposed to the eye of strangers, and, desiring her to go down to the town to purchase provisions for her unexpected guests, he slipped an angel into her horny hand.</p>
<p>She thanked him not, but, stirring up the fire which, according to a good Northumbrian custom, had been smouldering all night upon the hearth, she peered inquisitively at Samuel and his master, though the light was too feeble for her to distinguish more than an imperfect outline of their forms. But still she mistrusted such company, and, rendered selfish and suspicious by age, solitude, and penury, apprehensions of evil crossed her mind as she again looked on them, after Milborne had left the cottage, and, leaping from point to point
down the steep acclivity before her door, was lost in the mist which canopied the valley. Determined to have a good view of her guests,
in spite of the priest’s commands, she returned into the hovel, and tarried for some time in expectation of their awakening; but, worn out
by their previous fatigue, they slept so long and soundly that her patience was finally exhausted, and she was compelled to go down to the town without satisfying her curiosity.</p>
<p>She made, however, all speed to return, and, much to her satisfaction, they were both when she re-entered her cottage, Samuel wisely shaking up the hether which had been his bed, and his master pacing the floor with clasped arms, as if engrossed by his own thoughts he took no note of surrounding objects. The noise, which Ailsey made in opening the door, sufficed however to break off the thread of his reflections; and, turning suddenly round, with the glad expectation of welcoming his daughter, he slightly started at beholding the withered, ill-looking old woman, between sixty and seventy, who appeared on the threshold in her stead.</p>
<p>Ailsey, for her part, was not less amazed; but, though she instantly recognized the strangers, she had sufficient command over herself to give no sign which might betray her knowledge. She was, nevertheless, deeply offended that Milborne had not trusted her with the secret when he subjected her to all the danger which might arise from concealing
it; and indignant likewise that her altered and fortune should be exposed to those who had known her in better days, it was with no good will that she addressed her guests: </p>
<p>“I warrant, sirs, you are thinking it lang for your breakfast,” she began; “but when gentry come to sic’ poor lodgings, they mon put up with troubles as weel as meaner folks.”</p>
<p>“I am too much obliged for your shelter,” said Ogle kindly, “to find fault with trifles, my good woman.”</p>
<p>“Good woman—or bad woman, I guess you ken little about it!” replied the crone; ” but it seems misfortune teaches people humility, or ane with sic a fine laced doublet would never have demeaned his sel’ to sleep in my auld bed, I warrant me.”</p>
<p>“It is indeed a cruel mistress!” said the gentleman with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Ay, truly, it’ s few bodies but knows that, afore they gan under the sod,” mumbled the crone, proceeding to prepare the breakfast; “and muckle may her lessons profit you; but there are some horses so wild, a ploughed field winna tame them, and you may break their legs afore you master their spirit.”</p>
<p>“And many that cannot stand ill usage,” returned her guest.</p>
<p>“But die o’ their own pride,” rejoined the crone, with a bitter smile, as she took another survey of her former master’s emaciated and
altered form. It was probable the gentleman did not hear her last words, for they were low and indistinctly spoken; nor, on returning from the back door with a mug of water, did she think fit to renew the conversation, but, sitting down with her distaff in a corner of the chimney, whilst her guests partook of the meal prepared for them, she seemed to forget their presence, and drew her thread and twirled her spindle with indefatigable celerity.</p>
<p>But Ogle listened the while, with wonder and almost awe, as, in a cracked voice, and apparently unconsciously, though in reality with the crabbed purpose of inflicting pain, she sang snatches of an old song he remembered to have heard in his childhood, as a sort of prophecy which had been handed down in his family from generation to generation, through
many succeeding centuries. He looked round at the bent, grey-haired, withered old crone, where, with a plaid cast across her head, and
the full light of the fire falling upon her tawny arms and shrivelled face, she proceeded with her toil; and, though he could not distinctly
remember that he had ever before seen her, yet there was an expression in those features, there was something in the sound of that voice,
and especially of the words it uttered, that forcibly recalled to his mind past days and scenes of happiness, in such a heart-sickening
contrast to his present desolate and forlorn position, that, with a cold shudder, the wretched man turned away his eyes, and sought to be deaf to her song. But, like the voice of an evil conscience, the more he strove to forget it the louder it seemed to swell upon his distracted car, screaming forth at intervals the following words:</p>
<div><p>When the waters of the well<br>
Wi’ the bluid o’ murder swell;<br>
When the hunter to his hall<br>
Is brought back in sable pall;<br>
When the white veil of a bride<br>
Doth the widow’s blushes hide;<br>
Then must Ogle bow his head,<br>
All his brightest days have fled;<br>
Fate will seize its destined prey,<br>
Lands and honoure pass away.<br>
Age may kneel, and youth may weep,<br>
Death will plenteous harvest reap.</p></div>
<p>Ogle listened and listened till every fibre became as a nerve that caught the sound of this wild strain, which rose and fell, with wandering
and uncertain cadence, until he seemed to hear in its strange melody the death-wail of his race sung by some evil harbinger that haunts the autumn woods.</p>
<p>“Have saints or demons taught you that wild song, to din it in my ears like an accursed prophetess of olden time? Peace, if you would not madden me!” exclaimed the unfortunate gentleman, at length unable to repress his agony.</p>
<p>“Nay, truly, I had no need to take lessons of either the ane or the other,” returned the hag; “it ‘s as auld as Cheviot, and knawn to a’ the country side, as weel as to me. Let them it concerns look to it, for I’m none o’ the doomed race.”</p>
<p>“Doomed, indeed!” was Ogle’s laconic reply: and, laying his head above his crossed arms, he relapsed into his former silence.</p>
<p>“Hoot, master! never mind that cankered old crone,” said Samuel, in a low voice, when he saw, with sorrow, how greatly he was moved. “I wonder what made Milborne bring us here, for I have known her many a day, and she was never any other but the arrantest spitfire on this side the border.”</p>
<p>But Ogle made him no reply, and, over powered by the darkest apprehensions, counted, with increasing anxiety, the moments of his
daughter’s delay.</p>

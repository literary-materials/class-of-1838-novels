<!-- CHAPTER III. -->

<p>Harry was now permitted to visit Oakfield, as Mr. Cleveland’s paternal estate was called, whenever he pleased; for, besides having abated somewhat of his prejudices, Mr. Farnham was too much occupied with other matters to attend to his son’s pastimes. Independent of his friendship for Cuthbert Cleveland, Oakfield had many attractions for young Farnham. It was a sweet spot, unrivalled throughout the neighbourhood in the beauty of its situation. An artist would immediately have selected it for its happy combination of rich woodlands, undulating meadows, blooming orchards, and fields of golden corn. The farmhouse itself was of an architecture the most picturesque; a part of it which was very ancient, bore evidence of its having been, at some remote period, a building of more pretensions than at present. The ivy-wreathed windows were arched and lofty, and here and there were seen fragments of entablatures and sculptured cornices. The modern part of the house was built in a much more rustic style, and appeared, from its irregularity, to have been added from time to time, according to the wants or means of each successive generation, but the whole formed just such a mass of building as one would choose for a drawing. Much taste had been shown by its present possessor; he had planted around it and beautified it in every way possible. What in his father’s time had been a paved court, Mr. Cleveland had converted into lawn and flower garden, and though the venerable sycamores still overshadowed the high pointed roof, they were now festooned with honeysuckles and clematis. The front of the house was covered with a vine, intermixed here and there with jessamine and roses; and against many projecting gables at the back and sides, fruit-trees of most luxuriant growth, and of the choicest kind, were neatly trained.</p>

<p>The same admirable propriety was carried into the farming department. Mr. Cleveland, who was a first-rate agriculturist, prided himself upon having everything perfect in its kind. His breed of horned cattle and horses were unrivalled in the county, and his land, which was in the highest state of cultivation, bore the heaviest crops. Many were the silver-cups, prizes awarded by agricultural societies, that graced his sideboard of polished oak. He was an enterprising farmer, and added to the love of the experimental, which might otherwise have proved injurious, both knowledge and judgment. These qualities combined, made him a blessing to the parish, whose poor, if deserving, always found work and liberal pay at Oakfield. Indeed, the hospitality practised there towards equals and inferiors was almost patriarchal.</p>

<p>Master Harry, who seemed quite to have conquered his dislike to farmers, was delighted to have the run of Mr. Cleveland’s farm-yard, where, instead of meeting with anything to offend the most fastidious eye, everything was a picture of neatness. Nor relished he less the produce of Mrs. Cleveland’s dairy; hot curds and whey, the sillabubs frothing in the glass, the rich cloutedcream, eaten with some of the indulgent matron’s preserved apricots, and now and then a tumbler of cider.</p>

<p>Cuthbert had a little sister, a pretty rosycheeked creature, of whom both boys were very fond, vying with each other who should spoil her the most; and Susie dearly loved a game at highromps, or to be placed before one or the other of them upon the pony, and galloped round the paddock at full speed; or to be covered over with new-made hay in the hay-field. Her little smiling face was sure to greet them in the porch on their arrival upon a half-holiday, from whence she would dart away into some nook or corner of the house or garden, in order to be pursued and caught. In a word, Oakfield became, in every sense, a second home to Harry. If his pony was sick, it must go to the farm to be nursed, or if himself were ailing, Mrs. Cleveland’s jellies and cheesecakes were a sovereign remedy. What a pity that so much innocent happiness should be interrupted yet so it was.</p>

<p>A county election was about to disturb the tranquillity of Ardlington and the surrounding parishes. The rival candidates were Lord Shafto and a Mr. Brymore, the former a restless and ambitious man, of violent party politics, the latter a gentleman, who, although brought up to the law, and for a time practising it, now resided upon his own estate in the county, without the exercise of any professional functions whatever, excepting such as his parliamentary and magisterial duties imposed; his public character was that of moderation, strict integrity, and attachment to the constitution of his country: his private character was equally wel known and respected by all classes.</p>

<p>Mr. Farnham had already begun to take an active part in the contest; such matters being quite after his own heart. He espoused the cause of the viscount, who was an old friend (if it be not profanation of the term thus to apply it.) and ally of his in his former public career. Lord Shafto had lost no time in writing to him to solicit his support, and Mr. Farnham was one of those gentlemen who proposed him as a candidate at the first electioneering meeting. The canvass on both sides commenced, and with it the slander and illwill common upon such occasions. It was supposed that the struggle would be a hard one, for Lord Shafto was what is called “the man of the people,” and Mr. Brymore, from his services in the county as a magistrate, and a promoter of everything that promised to be advantageous to it, possessed, and deservedly, great influence.</p>

<p>Rarely since his residence at the manor-house had Mr. Farnham turned his steps towards Oakfield. The first time he went there it was to request Mr. Cleveland to give his opinion about a horse he wished to purchase, for our great man chose to have some plea for his visit, to prevent the possibility of his neighbour taking it as a personal compliment. Mr. Cleveland passed his opinion upon the horse, and further rendered Mr. Farnham some essential services, but he carefully abstained from going to the manor-house, lest his so doing should be construed into a return of the visit; his spirit being much too independent to tolerate anything like condescension.</p>

<p>He was, then, not a little surprised when he received one morning a friendly call from Mr. Farnham, who, after chatting with him familiarly for a quarter of an hour, during which time he regretted more than once that Mr. Cleveland’s occupations and his own retired and studious habits occasioned them to see so little of each other, ended by giving him an invitation to dine at the manor-house.</p>

<p>Mr. Cleveland expressed his thanks for the honour intended him, but declined it, saying he never dined from home excepting sometimes with Mr. Elwood, or with his own or wife’s relations. Mr. Farnham good humouredly replied that all positive rules were bad, and the sooner they were broken the better; however, he could not prevail.</p>
    
<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland saw through this sudden effort at civility on the part of their aristocratic neighbour. The honest yeoman had not only a vote himself, but also considerable influence with others, for several of his workmen possessed each a cottage and land sufficient to give them votes, and might be supposed likely to take the same side as their employer.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his recent repulse, Oakfield was the very first place Mr. Farnham repaired to, upon the actual commencement of the canvass. He was received, as every one always was there, with frank politeness. After a little preamble by way of introduction, Mr. Farnham began, “I expect Lord Shafto down in a few days; I hope, Mr. Cleveland, you will allow me to name you to him as a friend and ally.”</p>

<p>“That is a plain question, Mr. Farnham,” replied Cleveland, “and demands a plain answer. I cannot promise my support to Lord Shafto.”</p>

<p>“Promise! oh that would be premature: we none of us <i>promise</i> anything till we hear what he has got to say for himself.”</p>
    
<p>“I have, sir, heard <i>that</i> ever since he has been a public man, and am free to confess that I do not approve it.”</p>

<p>“You are prejudiced, I fear, Mr. Cleveland; you cannot help owning that Lord Shafto has his country’s interest at heart. Though himself a member of it, he is an enemy to the aristocracy, and never loses an opportunity of upholding the rights of the people. You never find <i>him</i> robbing the country, or accepting of place or pensions.”</p>

<p>“If report speaks true, that is no fault of his though; you will excuse my frankness, Mr. Farnham, and on the present occasion merge the friend in the public man.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Cleveland; this were no free country if a man might not speak his mind boldly both of prince and peasant.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” continued Cleveland, “I am one of those old-fashioned fellows who like consistency in all things, and none can I find in the conduct of Lord Shafto, whether public or private. He talks of equality loudly, and has always done so, and of the natural rights of man, and yet is more. haughty and difficult of access, to his inferiors, except at election time, than any nobleman breathing. He speaks also of his great regard for the working classes; yet never was there a harder landlord, or a more irregular paymaster. He is strict even to cruelty in the preservation of his game, which appears, indeed, to be almost his sole inducement for visiting once a year his seat in this county. He advocates the education of the people, and condemns the clergy all the while he is neglecting his own wife,——”</p>

<p>“Nay, but, my good sir,” interrupted Mr. Farmham, “this is carrying things too far. We must look to <i>measures</i>, not <i>men</i>.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but good measures are not safe in the hands of bad men; however plausible and fair their professions in the beginning, give them power, and they will pervert them in the end. Now, sir, you know, better than I can tell you, how well off and contented most of the labouring poor in this district are,—they have plenty of employment,—have relief when they require it,—are oppressed by no one, for all the neighbouring gentry are remarkably considerate towards them, and, in short, have no grievance whatever to complain of, unless that of working for their daily bread, which must always be the portion of some, can be called so. What will Lord Shafto do? that which he has often dome elsewhere:—he will come down here and make violent speeches about tyranny and starvation, and an abuse of rights, and a thousand other charges, impossible for the mob, who will listen to him, to understand. This village will be inundated with these violent speeches, and others equally mischievous, put into print, and every ale-house will be crowded with brawlers, swearing, blaspheming, and abusing those of their superiors and their spiritual pastors whom they have been accustomed hitherto to respect; crying out that they are enslaved and ill-used, and ready to cut the throat of any man who shall dare to differ from them in opinion. Nor will the mischief end with the election; besides a deal of rancour and animosity amongst neighbours who have votes, the poor who have none will continue to grumble instead of working. Yes, those who now eat their bread and cheese in peace, blessing God in sincerity of heart, will henceforth eat it with curses and discontent. Pardon me, Mr. Farnham; to you who are, I understand, yourself a fine speaker, my rude way of expressing myself may, I fear, be displeasing.” </p>

<p>“On the contrary,” replied Mr. Farnham, in his most courteous and urbane manner, “I have nothing to pardon except that your manly eloquence is not enlisted in our cause, Mr. Cleveland.”</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” resumed Cleveland, “one word about Mr. Brymore. You will tell me that he has not the shining abilities of my Lord Shafto,—possibly not. People also sneer at him for being a country gentleman; why so? He is not a whit the less able to understand and uphold the interests of the land he lives in, on that account, I should suppose; besides, though he is no ambitious man, and never was a place-hunter, he is a thorough man of business, as every one who has had to do with him can testify. He is the best of landlords, and was among the first to lower his rents. His private character is irreproachable, he is just and benevolent to all. The poor who live upon his estates are happy and thriving, each having his own bit of allotment to cultivate, and every encouragement held out to them by their landlord, to be sober and industrious. He does not rail against the clergy, nor propose, in order to effect some doubtful good, to overturn the government of the country; but endeavours to steer his course independent of party, and I verily believe, gives his vote in parliament according to his conscience. Now, I ask, is such a man likely to barter the interests of his fellow subjects for any advantage to himself?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brymore,” answered Mr. Farnham, “is no doubt a very worthy private character, but, my good sir, he is not fitted for the times. He sees things in a matter of fact, straight-forward way, but he has not the talent to seize with promptitude the right moment for introducing measures required by the present crisis; a talent possessed by my friend Lord Shafto in an eminent degree. I repeat, we must look to measures, not men. You are no enemy to reform, I am sure, Mr. Cleveland.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Cleveland, “I should consider any man little better than an idiot who should declare that whatever was wrong, and had been proved to be so, ought to be persisted in, because it had been so for this or that period of time. As the world goes on, changes naturally take place, which require that other changes should be made to meet them; but it is in the mode by which this is to be brought about that my Lord Shafto and I differ. To use a homely comparison, if a man wishes to repair his house, he does not begin by tearing down the decayed timbers, so as to endanger the fabric itself, but he goes to work - cautiously, propping with the utmost care those parts which are sound, lest they should be shaken by the removal of those that are perishing, and which, for still greater security, he probably takes away piecemeal.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Farnham, “but you will give this matter a little consideration, before you decide. Perhaps, after you have favoured Lord Shafto with a candid hearing, you may find that you and he do not differ so much as you imagine. Besides, my dear sir, such near neighbours as you and I are must not pull in opposite directions. It would be quite a reproach to us.”</p>
    
<p>“Mr. Farnham,” replied Cleveland, mildly, but firmly, “I am as much grieved as you can be that we do not pull together, but I will not attempt to deceive you,—I cannot vote for Lord Shafto.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cleveland, I am sorry for it.—Good morning to you, sir.” So saying, Mr. Farnham bowed slightly, stalked out of the house, and mounting the horse held by his servant in attendance, rode away.</p>

<p>At first, no other interest was felt by the two boys in the election than that arising out of the comparative merits of the coloured ribbons distributed by the rival candidates. “I shall wear blue,”—”And I yellow,” were said in good natured exultation; but gradually the party spirit of their elders descended upon these youngsters. Harry Farnham was the soonest infected by it, and, strange as it may appear, expressed neither sorrow nor amazement when his father forbade his visits to Oakfield, and further enjoined that he should hold no other intercourse with Cuthbert Cleveland than that which their meeting during school-hours at Mr. Elwood’s rendered unavoidable.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Cleveland and Cuthbert understood the meaning of this coolness, which would never, however, have originated with them. “Never mind, my boy,” said the former, “this whim of Harry’s will pass away with the election; if not, his friendship is not worth having.” Mr. Elwood looked on in silent concern, for he saw in it another proof of the instability of Harry’s disposition.</p>

<p>The youth himself was in the height of his glory: his passion for novelty and gaiety found fresh food every day in what was passing around him, Lord Shafto and one or two of his adherents having come down to the manor-house, with a splendid equipage and fine horses, to canvass the county in person.</p>
    
<p>As we do not intend to occupy our pages with the history of an election, suffice it to say that the result was favourable to what was called the popular party. A demon had gone forth in the land to prepare the way for a man of Lord Shafto’s violent politics. Mr. Cleveland’s prediction was fulfilled to the letter; that district which had been so tranquil, so prosperous, so contented, became a scene of turbulence and dissatisfaction. After the chairing of Lord Shafto, and his departure for the metropolis, peace was in some measure restored, and things began to go on more comfortably, but still a great deal of rancour and ill-will remained in the breasts of those who had taken an active part in the contest; and, indeed, those who had not, from the urchin just old enough to fling a handful of mud, to the pauper who hobbled to the workhouse-door, to mutter imprecations against that candidate whom he was pleased to call “the enemy of the people.”</p>

<p>The exultation of the Farnhams was interrupted by an occurrence unforseen as it was afflicting: Henry was attacked by a malignant fever. Whether it arose from the over excitement of the life he had been leading, or that he caught it in the county-town where his father was foolish enough to permit him to remain during the polling, is uncertain, but it showed itself under its most formidable aspect. Mr. Farnham was distracted, for he really loved his son, and some promises Lord Shafto had recently made him, invested this sole heir of his house and name with additional importance. The best medical advice the neighbourhood afforded was called in, but very little hope was given of his recovery.</p>

<p>All Cuthbert Cleveland’s resentment forsook him the moment he heard of his friend’s illness: he begged to be allowed to visit him, but this was not permitted. The fever was considered highly infectious, and neither Mr. nor Mrs. Cleveland would hear of their son’s periling his life for a friendship which appeared to have in it so little of stability. Moreover, Harry had been forbidden all intercourse with Cuthbert, and the prohibition, so far at least as they knew, had not been revoked.</p>

<p>Cuthbert was obliged, therefore, to content himself with inquiries, which were made almost hourly of Mr. Elwood and the servants from the manorhouse; but when he at length heard, that during an interval when the delirium of the fever had abated, the poor sufferer, had asked for his beloved companion, entreating that he might be sent for, Cuthbert could hold back no longer. Neither parental authority, wounded pride, nor any other consideration, had weight with him. Harry was ill, perhaps dying, and had asked for him. He resolved, come what might, to visit him; but how to accomplish it was the difficulty. He knew that the servants would not, unsanctioned by their master, admit him to the sick chamber, and to apply to Mr. Farnham for leave, would only be to court a denial.</p>

<p>It was summer time; Harry’s window was kept open night and day; this Cuthbert knew, for he had watched it with anxiety ever since his young friend had taken to his bed. It was situated immediately above a stone portico at the side of the house, which leading only to a disused servants’-hall, was not much frequented. Up the pillars of this portico, and alighting upon its roof, had often been the sport of Harry and Cuthbert to climb, and so in at the window. Cuthbert’s plan was to gain access to his sick friend by this mode, without asking permission of any one. Accordingly, in the dusk of evening, having watched his opportunity, he slipped away from his father’s house and pursued his way to the manor-house. At the entrance-gate he met M. Dupont, Mr. Farmham’s valet, and eagerly inquired of him how his young master was.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mistair Cutberr!” replied the Frenchman, “<i>il est bien mal</i>, verr bad indeed. <i>Les medecins l’ont abandonné</i>; dat is, de doctors give him quite up. <i>Il a le transport au cerveau</i>; dat is, he not at all <i>raisonable</i>. He ask for you, Mistair Cutberr, tree four time to-day.”</p>
    
<p>“Well, Mr. Dupont, do you think they would let me see him, if I were to go?”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi non</i>! not at all,” replied the valet, shrugging his shoulders, “it would be verr <i>dangereuse pour vous</i>.”</p>
    
<p>“Oh, I don’t mind that,” returned Cuthbert; but M. Dupont had made his bow, and passed on. “I <i>will</i> see him though,” said Cuthbert to himself, as he made his way, without further impediment, to the east terrace. By this time it was nearly dark, excepting what light proceeded from the newly-risen moon. All around was still; not a leaf stirred. Cuthbert placed his hand upon a projection of one of the pillars, and easily raised himself up, as he had often done before, to the roof, immediately under Harry’s window. All was as silent within the chamber as outside : the curtain was partially drawn, and Cuthbert, raising it with a cautious hand, let himself down into the room. A lamp burned upon a small table at the further end of it. The poor invalid was tossing on his restless bed, and the fat nurse was nodding in her chair. Cuthbert stole with noiseless steps to the bed-side: he was shocked to perceive the alteration visible in his friend’s countenance. His cheeks were hollow, and flushed with fever; his lips. parched, and his eyes, which looked unnaturally large and bright, had a wandering expression. “Harry,” said Cuthbert, in a soft voice, “Harry, my poor dear fellow, I am come to stay with you.”</p>
    
<p>The sufferer knew his voice was instantly, and, putting his burning hand into Cuthbert’s, he murmured, “How kind:” but his voice was hoarse, and he articulated with difficulty.</p>

<p>“What can I get for you, Harry?” asked Cuthbert, perceiving, by the motion of his hand, that he wanted something. Harry pointed to a tumbler, filled with fluid, which stood upon the table: it was lemonade. In reaching it, Cuthbert threw down an empty vial. The noise waked the nurse, who got up from her chair, rubbing her eyes, and staring in wonder and alarm on the intruder.</p>

<p>“Don’t scream, Mrs. Wilson,” said he in a whisper, for, being a matron of the village, she was well known to him; “‘tis only me, so there’s no occasion for you to look so frightened. I will explain it all to you by-and-bye. Harry wants his lemonade, so you see it’s lucky I came just when I did.”</p> 

<p>How he had come, whether lucky or not, was a mystery to Mrs. Wilson; but, ashamed of being caught mapping, when she ought to have been watching, she abstained from reproof. Harry drank plentifully of the cooling beverage, and soon after, with his hand locked in that of Cuthbert, fell into a profound sleep</p>.

<p>When Mr. Farnham heard in the morning of young Cleveland’s stolen entrance into his son’s chamber, he was at first very angry; but the motive that had prompted such an extraordinary measure was one so purely, so affectionately disinterested, the heart must have been callous indeed that could have cherished more than a momentary resentment. Still he was vexed that it had occurred.</p>

<p>“They can’t send me away now, Harry,” said Cuthbert to his friend, who, upon waking in the morning out of the soundest sleep he had enjoyed since his illness, was so much better as to be able to listen to the conversation of those around him; “here I <i>must</i> stay, for no body would take me in.”</p>

<p>Mr. Farnham sent to apprise the family at Oakfield of Cuthbert being at the manor-house, and suggested, that as he had now run every risk of the contagion, it would be better that he should remain where he was for the present. To this Mr. Cleveland offered no objection, so Cuthbert had a little bed made up for him in a room adjoining that of the invalid. From that time Harry began to recover. Whether the crisis of the disorder had arrived, or that it was owing to the presence of his friend, we presume not to determine; but so it was. When he quitted his bed, and was allowed to take food, he declared that a jar of preserved apricots, sent him by Mrs. Cleveland, did him more good than all the physic prescribed by his doctors. Cuthbert did not take the fever, and was amply repaid for his zeal and courage, by the warmth of Harry’s affection, which appeared to have returned with more than its former vigour.</p>

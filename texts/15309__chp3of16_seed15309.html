<!-- CHAPTER III. AT HOME. --> 

<p>The sound of approaching wheels was recognised by the expecting listeners within, as Walter and his sister arrived at home. Catherine had scarcely time to spring from the little phaeton, before she was surrounded by her sisters, who were followed by their Aunt Margaret, chiding them for running out upon the snow, yet imitating their example by hastening to embrace her niece. The greeting was as warm as Catherine could desire: the children’s exclamations of delight were too natural to be insincere, while her aunt’s tearful eyes attested equal satisfaction; and she accompanied them into the house, mentally resolving to deserve this love by imparting to them the benefits of pure precepts and a consistent example. Stopping a moment in the hall to throw off her cumbrous cloak, she would have proceeded immediately to her father’s chamber, feeling her happiness imperfect until she had satisfied her anxieties respecting him; but Mrs. Harcourt (for so Aunt Margaret was always called) interposed, with the assurance that he was enjoying a tranquil sleep, which it might not be prudent to interrupt. This favourable symptom greatly relieved her fears; and she suffered her youngest sister to draw her towards their usual sitting-room, while the others clung round her, forgetful of her probable fatigue, and only eager to catch her eye, and by some endearing word to obtain another embrace. Catherine’s face was beaming with smiles, as she entered the apartment, preceded by little Fanny, gaily announcing “Sister Kate;” but she was conscious of a sudden and involuntary change in its expression, when a young lady, who had been seated beside the worktable, timidly advanced to meet her, and was introduced as their governess by the children, who seemed to regard her with none of that fear which it is sometimes considered so salutary to inspire. Catherine coldly bowed, and Miss Arden as coldly acknowledging the distant civility, but colouring to the very temples, remained standing, until, after a minute’s delay, which had been occupied in ordering coffee, Mrs. Harcourt bustled into the room, and began, with her accustomed haste, untying her niece’s bonnet, and relieving her of the pelisse and shawl, in which she was still enveloped. The young governess did not approach with offers of assistance, but she drew the sofa near the fire, placed a footstool beside the warmest corner, and removed the books and work that littered the table, upon which a servant was now placing the tray for the traveller’s refreshment. While Miss Arden thus busied herself, Catherine, with less kindness, was closely scrutinising her appearance, at the same time listening and replying to her sister’s endless queries, and to her Aunt Margaret’s congratulations on her own improved and blooming looks. The object of her curiosity was a pale, delicate girl, with dark blue eyes, a calm, ingenuous brow, and a sweet expression playing about the lips, which seemed to say, notwithstanding her present gravity, that smiles were no strangers there. A few bright auburn curls shaded her face, and the more luxuriant ringlets fell carelessly upon her neck; while the roundness of her cheek and the girlish slightness of her figure, told her extreme youth, and caused her to appear more as an elder sister of her pupils than their guardian and instructress. Catherine was struck by her beauty and simplicity, which, in other circumstances, would have won her immediate favour; but an unacknowledged prejudice opposed the kindly feeling that might have been excited, and her purpose gained additional strength, as she somewhat hastily decided, from this momentary examination, that Miss Arden was less fitted to be the children’s governess than their companion, and it was therefore high time that a more efficient teacher should take her place.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Mrs. Harcourt was providing for the comfort of her niece, inviting her to the sofa by the fire, and urging Walter to join his sister in partaking of the coffee and sandwiches that she was sure must be much needed after their drive from town. Walter good-humouredly obeyed, although protesting against the necessity in his case; and he drew a chair to the table, while Mrs. Harcourt took a seat beside Catherine, and began to prepare the coffee. But she stopped with a sudden thought, as her eye glanced upon a time-piece opposite. “Now, that I recollect,” said she, “your father was ordered to take his medicine again at nine o’clock! I see it is pretty near the hour, so I had better just steal into his room and ask Hollis if he is awake. If not, I will not have him disturbed; but still, you know, it is as well to ascertain. Grace, my dear,” she continued, turning to Miss Arden, “be kind enough to take my place, and pour out the coffee, while I see what is best to be done.”</p>

<p>“<i>Grace!</i>” repeated Catherine to herself, as her aunt left the room, and the young governess, with a little embarrassment, approached the table, “this is familiar, indeed, my good Aunt Margaret; and I must prepare, it appears, to find a rival where I expected only a dependent. Mais, bientôt nous changerons tout cela.” And, satisfied with this thought, she sipped her coffee in good-humour, gaily conversing with her brother, but only addressing a few words of the most common-place civility to the timid girl who sat silently beside her. Her mind was full of her own project, and she saw not that her present conduct was ungenerous and unamiable. Having predetermined that Miss Arden should be removed, it followed that, whether the resolution were justifiable or otherwise, her own manner towards her should be constrained and cold; for the consciousness of her purpose precluded all genuine cordiality, and thus, while meditating an injury, she acted as though she had received one.</p>

<p>Catherine’s mother—a mother deeply to be lamented, for to the fondest maternal affection she had added unusual strength and purity of principle—died soon after this, her eldest daughter, entered her fifteenth year; grief having assisted disease in hastening her to the grave, as she had recently lost two lovely children by a melancholy accident; and though she struggled for resignation to the darkest dispensations of her God, her weak frame was unable to sustain the double burden of mental and of bodily affliction. Her loss was partly supplied to Mr. Harcourt by the kindness of his sister, who only waited his request to take the charge of his family until Catherine should be old enough to relieve her. The three youngest children were also committed solely to their Aunt Margaret’s care, during the two years immediately subsequent to Mrs. Harcourt’s death; afterwards their education was entrusted to Grace Arden, who, without excelling in the lighter accomplishments, possessed qualifications more essential for the task of early instruction, in a mind well stored with useful general knowledge, and an understanding, quick in the perception of her deficiencies, which continually urged her on to study and improvement. Her dove-like gentleness of temper, her innocent hilarity of disposition, and, above all, the never-failing kindness of her heart, had won for her “golden opinions” from every member of Mr. Harcourt’s household; the children loved her like another sister; Walter and his father looked upon her as belonging to the family; while Aunt Margaret, in the simplicity of her nature, had planned a friendship between Catherine and Grace, which would ripen speedily, she fancied, as each should become acquainted with the excellences of the other. Nor had she failed to impart this expectation to her young favourite; and Grace, though very distrustful of her own merits, suffered herself to dwell upon so delightful an idea, and indulged in many an hour of day-dreaming, which had no other foundation than a modest hope of hereafter gaining some share in Miss Harcourt’s confidence and affection.</p>

<p>Little prospect of such honour being vouchsafed to her appeared, to cheer the young governess on the first night of Catherine’s return. Never before had the manners of any individual tacitly reminded her that she was only admitted to that fire-side circle as an inferior and a dependent; but now she read this meaning in the chilling ceremony with which she heard herself addressed, and she saw that the studied and scrupulous politeness of Catherine’s behaviour was but assumed as a shield against the possibility of her presumptuous advances. Grace felt more inclined to regret than to resent the frigid demeanour of the stranger from whose arrival she had hoped so much, especially when she perceived, by Catherine’s deportment towards Walter and her sisters, that she could not only feel warm affection, but was gifted with many of those characteristics which never fail to secure love in return. And poor Grace, who had no sister, and whose one long-cherished wish had been to obtain a friend, young, hopeful, and enthusiastic as herself, saw the visions of imagination realized in the winning sweetness of Catherine’s smile, and the playful animation of her looks and words, while the expression of her dark, intelligent eyes seemed to speak of higher qualities, reserved for graver hours;—and she sighed to think how happy she might have been in associating with one who seemed to be all that her heart most earnestly desired, and how dearly she <i>could</i> have loved her, if she had not been so soon convinced that her affection was not sought, and would not be regarded.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Harcourt returned, Catherine found that her father was still sleeping, and so tranquilly, that Hollis, the old nurse, who had lived with the family since the time of Walter’s infancy, was sure that such rest would be of more benefit than medicine, and accordingly he was allowed to remain undisturbed. Catherine submitted to this further delay the more patiently, as Grace considerately withdrew from the apartment, leaving her to the enjoyment of uninterrupted conversation with her brother and her aunt, free from the restraint imposed by a stranger’s presence; and seated amongst so many loved ones, she soon forgot all else in the pleasure of their society, until the children, clustering round her, demanded a share of her attention.</p>

<p>“We are all so glad that you are come back!” said Elizabeth, the eldest of the three. “It is so very long since last Christmas, Fanny had nearly forgotten you; so we used to show her the picture that hangs up in papa’s room, and tell, her it was like sister Catherine. Little Fanny, you know, she is only four years old, so ‘tis no wonder that she should forget you.”</p>

<p>“But Aunt Margaret does not think the picture is at all like you, now,” interposed Maria, “nor Miss Arden either; for I whispered her just now, when she was putting away her work-basket, and she said you were much prettier.”</p>

<p>“And oh, sister!” exclaimed Elizabeth, eagerly, “on the fifth of November, we were wishing that you were here to see the beauti- ful fire-works that Walter brought from London, and Miss Arden told us to count the days which were to come before the twenty-second of December; so we found that there were forty-six, and then she tied forty-six knots upon a piece of ribbon, telling us to untie a knot every evening, and she said that, when you were a little girl, you had perhaps done so too, as the holidays drew near.”</p>

<p>“I have done something like it,” said Catherine, laughing, “since I was a very little girl.”</p>

<p>“By the bye, Catherine,” said her brother, suddenly, “you have not seen Miss Arden before. It is scarcely necessary for me to ask if you are not prepossessed by her appearance.”</p>

<p>I am glad <i>you</i> do not call her “Grace” thought Catherine; and she carelessly replied, “You must not expect me to form any judgment at present. A few days will perhaps give me some insight into her character.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Walter, hastily; “if you were a physiognomist you would find it written upon her brow.”</p>

<p>“Grace is a good girl,” observed Mrs. Harcourt, “an excellent girl; and she has been quite a comfort to me, I assure you, my dear; especially last autumn, when, as I afterwards wrote to you, I was so long confined to my room from the effects of a severe cold. Very kind and attentive she was then; besides the children are all fond of her, and it is really wonderful how rapidly they improve under her care.”</p>

Catherine said not a word; and Walter, whose penetration was somewhat keener than Mrs. Harcourt’s, prevented the continuation of the subject by an attempt to awaken little Fanny, who had brought a stool to her sister’s feet, and seating herself there, had fallen fast asleep, with her head resting on Catherine’s knee. Aunt Marga- ret’s thoughts were immediately diverted into another channel. “To bed! to bed! little people,” she exclaimed, to the children, who had been permitted to sit up beyond the usual hour, in honour of their sister’s return; and Catherine at the same moment rose, with an exclamation of weariness, expressing a wish to see her father before she retired to rest, but promising not to awake him if his slumber still continued. She was therefore accompanied by Mrs. Harcourt to the sick chamber, and gently unclosing the door, they entered with cautious footsteps, expecting to find all still and silent, and Hollis stationed beside the pillow, watching to prevent the slightest sound which might interrupt the invalid’s repose. And all was still and silent as they had anticipated; but greatly to Catherine’s displeasure, Miss Arden had taken the nurse’s place, and sat quietly at the fire, with a small volume in her hand, and the lamp carefully placed that the intervening curtains might shade its rays from the sleeper’s face. Grace caught the look of unconcealed surprise which greeted her appearance, and in a suppressed tone, she briefly explained to Mrs. Harcourt that Hollis had requested her to remain in the apartment during her temporary absence; but Catherine did not listen to this implied apology, for she turned quickly towards the bed, and the momentary confusion, slight as it was, awakening Mr. Harcourt, she rushed forward, and was immediately recognised, and clasped in his embrace. The governess stole unnoticed from the room; and Catherine, thus happy, thought nothing of the cold unkindness for which Grace was weeping bitterly in her solitary chamber, nor checked for a moment the selfish flow of her enjoyment, that conscience might inquire if her recent conduct had not wounded a heart not less sincere and affectionate than her own.

<p>Mr. Harcourt was much restored by his long and refreshing sleep; and Catherine remained with him until Hollis, after some previous hints had been disregarded, absolutely forbade all further conversation; she then quitted him for the night, and retired to her own apartment, resolving that her watchful attendance on the morrow should preclude the necessity for Miss Arden’s unwelcome presence at his bedside. Whilst preparing for rest, her thoughts reverted to the praises which Walter and her aunt had lavished upon the object of her unreasonable prejudice; and jealousy, though she would have disdained to acknowledge such a feeling, jealousy of the unpretending girl who had obtained their good opinion, came to aid a determination which had been originally suggested by a better motive: perceiving the opposition which she must expect, she was the more firmly bent upon the accomplishment of her plan,—still persuading herself, however, that a sense of duty influenced her mind, instead of the hidden pride and the self-will by which it was really governed. So easy is such deception, where there is no true and abiding conviction of the need of continual help from Heaven; and so inefficient are those purposes of holiness which are formed in a spirit of self-dependence, and without a heart-felt trust in the sustaining grace of God.</p>

<p>Fatigued by her journey, and by the excitement of the evening, Catherine felt little inclination to review the occurrences of the day, and to examine her thoughts, and words, and temper throughout its course; but she knelt to offer her accustomed prayer, and satisfying herself with a few well-chosen words of thanksgiving, of acknowledgment of unworthiness, and of supplication for continued goodness, she thus carelessly closed the first night of her return to her father’s roof—of that return which she had often told herself, should eventually occa- sion such a reformation there. Yet how much was forgotten in these hurried and brief devotions, which should have been confessed and earnestly repented! What self-approval—displeasing to Him, whose dwelling is with the lowly and the contrite:—what unjust judgment of her friend, evincing so little of the charity which “hopeth all things:”—what yielding to un-holy passions, with the first slight temptation that assailed her! This, and much more than this, might have rushed back upon her memory, if she had occupied in a retrospect of the last twelve hours those thoughts which she gave to the prosecution of her own favourite schemes; but fearing no evil, she neglected to watch against danger, and many a lurking-place was secured for the sins which did “most easily beset” her, while she still believed that her heart was fervent and unfailing in its allegiance to the religion which she professed, and to the Master whose service she had chosen.</p>

<p>We must now pass over a period of four years, during which both the Honourable Charles Wentworth and our hero obtained their commissions; and whilst the former retired upon his half-pay to enjoy the luxuries of the shore, the latter still fagged on unweariedlv in a service that he ardently loved. Captain Yorick had voluntarily quitted Le Cerf at the period of the mutiny at Spithead; his ship’s company joined the mutineers, and their commander summoned them to the quarter-deck. It was a scene of intense interest. There stood Yorick by the wheel, his fine countenance expressive of mingled emotions—indignation, sorrow, and hope. He was greatly beloved by his people; they saw in him the ready, skilful seaman, and the daring, bold and intrepid leader. Near him were his officers, one of whom in particular was obnoxious to the men for his acts of tyranny—some asserted, cruelty; but when was a tyrant merciful? The lieutenant in question was not without his fears of retaliation; he was apprehensive of receiving personal insult and degradation, perhaps accompanied by personal violence: yet the <i>esprit de corps</i> did not forsake him; animal courage he was by no means deficient in, and he proudly looked defiance at his enemies. Im- patience and hauteur characterised the other lieutenants; the midshipmen relied implicitly upon their captain, feeling safe whilst under his protection; the master, a thorough tar of the old school, fretted and fumed, sometimes ejaculating a sort of half acknowledgment that the men had been goaded into revolt, and then heartily ” d——ing them for a set of mutinous rascals as disgraced themselves and the planks they trod upon.” The surgeon looked patiently on; whilst the purser, whose nipping propensities were by no means forgotten, stood abaft the mizen-mast, screwing up his mouth, and fidgetting first on one leg and then on the other, as if he was suffering severely from an attack of bowel complaint. The warrants—the nose-gays of the navy, who had obtained their rank by hard servitude before the mast, could not help old remembrances; and whilst their hearts were with the men, they did not dare do otherwise than stick by their order. The boatswain had been a tartar—the agent and the instrument of tyranny: and, indeed, in those days the treatment which the men re- ceived was anything but that which was cal- culated to make them like the King’s service. Mere boys, with scarcely a glimmering of knowledge of their profession, would raise their hands and strike a veteran who had nobly served his country and bled in her defence. When the hands were turned up, boatswain’s mates were stationed at each hatchway to freshen their way on deck by starting them with rope’s ends and rattans. Accidents were constantly occurring; there was a system of severity highly disgraceful to human beings. Yet when the British ensign was hoisted in the presence of an enemy, not a man shrunk from his post.</p>

<p>But where was our old friend the gunner? He chose a sort of neutral ground, midway between the rebels and their indignant commander; and he acted as a sort of pivot to the master as he paced the deck with irregular strides, sometimes stopping short against Mr. Blocks, and venting the vexation of his spirit in anathemas, and then gratifying his spleen by listening to the imprecations of the gunner, who called down anything but blessings on the visual organs of “Billy Pitt.” This of course was in a very subdued tone—a sort of audible whisper, heard only by the parties themselves.</p>

<p>And there about the mainmast and the fore-part of the quarter-deck, as far aft as the Jacob’s ladders, clustered the men, some looking mighty queer and sheepish, and others with countenances that nothing could change or daunt, as if resolutely determined to go through the work they had begun. The greater portion, however, seemed overawed by the presence of the captain, and frequently gave him sidelong glances to catch the expression of his face and see what he was likely to be at. Yorick let them stand for several minutes till their position became uneasy from suspense; and then coolly mounting the sky-light, he swept his eyes over the assembled company, and a dark scowl hung upon his brow. “And so, my men,” said he with calm deliberation, “you have thought proper to set discipline at defiance, and to outrage the laws of your country! Yes, my men <i>My</i> men—no! you are not <i>my</i> men, for then you would have stood by your captain, and have shown to the fleet thatyou looked up to him for protection against injury.—Men!—no, you are not men; you are mutinous rascals, who have hove overboard every manly principle!—Here I stand to accuse you of one of the worst of crimes that seamen can be guilty of,—that of rebellion against the duty you owe your country. That’s my text! England stands pre-eminent in naval glory;—the British ensign is triumphant wherever it is hoisted! Who has placed her in that proud station—who has made her flag respected?”—He paused a minute, whilst the glistening eyes of the tars seemed to respond to the question. He then proceeded,—”It is the prowess of her blue-jackets has done this!” The compliment was just, and in the enthusiasm of the moment the people were about to cheer, but the voice of their commander thundered forth, “Silence, fore and aft!—as mutineers, your cheers disgust me;—it is the voice of treason from the tongues of traitors! Be what you ever were till this moment! return to your allegiance to your King—return to your obedience to your officers, and I will join your cheers—nay, more, I will give the signal and show the rebels that you dare be men.” There was a whispering amongst the ship’s company, and many countenances manifested great restlessness of purpose. Yorick saw it, and continued,—”I was saying that England’s brave tars had made her what she is; will you then disgrace the colour of your cloth—will you dowse your true blue?—will you give the enemies of your country an advantage—will you tell them that Britannia no longer rules the waves?” No response was heard, though it was evident there was a mental struggle amongst the ringleaders.” Who has prompted you to this? what lubberly son of a —— has been pouring poison in your ears? An enemy hath done this! and will you strike to an enemy? Your country has been proud of your services—will you make her blush for your treason? You have nobly sustained your honour in the hour of peril—will you tarnish your good deeds by desertion? Look at those colours,” pointing to the ensign, “the emblem of your bravery! the boast of your countrymen! the genius that has presided over the hour of victory!—will you see it humbled before the tri-coloured rag—dowsed like a widow’s pig—trailed under the head-rails of a revolutionary craft?” Here the excitement amongst the assembled seamen grew irresistible. At first there was a single monosyllable uttered, “No:” it was repeated, went from mouth to mouth till it swelled into one general utterance, and ” No! we are ready to fight: show us the enemy, and they shall find we can stand by our colours to the last!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted the animated gunner, and was quickly joined by the master; “Hurrah!—I tould you so! D—n me, all’s right again!”</p>

<p>“Silence, officers!” roared Yorick; “and but that I respect your feelings, which I know from my own must be powerfully agitated, I should deem you fit objects for severe rebuke.” Then again turning to the people—”Men, will you return, then, to your duty?”</p> 

<p>The excitement had in some measure subsided from its ebullition, and for a minute or two no answer was returned. The seamen looked at each other or hung down their heads, till a remarkably tall handsome man, about five-and-thirty years of age, after one or two essays at last stepped boldly out from among the rest. There was an instantaneous commotion, and a general buzz of approbation succeeded as every eye was directed towards him. A flush of anger rushed over Yorick’s features:—his first impulse was to spring upon the man and fell him to the deck; but an instant’s reflection served to deter him: he had himself provoked the demonstration by his question, and proudly raising his head, he stood calmly awaiting the announcement of the tar;—besides, Will Scott was one of the best behaved and most trustworthy men in the ship; he was captain of the forecastle, and highly esteemed by both the officers and the crew. “May I speak, yer honour?” asked Will, respectfully touching the forelock of his hair, for his straw hat was in his hand. Yorick bent in token of acquiescence; and, whilst the most earnest attention prevailed, the seaman began,—”I ain’t much skilled, yer honour, in the argyfication o’ things as is out o’ my knowledge, nor do I know how to make out long speeches; but yer honour needs none o’ my calculations to tell you that which is laid down in your own chart of the human heart—that a man’s a man, and has all the feelings of a man, whether he ounly bends a suit of jacket and trowsers, or sails large in his long togs and scraper:—Captain Yorick knows it arn’t the duds any more than it is the station where a seaman, whether officer or man, performs his dooty. As for yer honour, there’s never a man, from the figure-head to the taffral, but loves and respects you, or as will dare to say, ‘Black’s the white o’ yer eye,’ seeing as you have always treated us well-rewarding them as you promised to reward, and punishing them as desarved punishment. We’ve not none on us got nothing to say again’ you, for a better captain never stepp’d ‘twixt stem and starn, for tarring all hands with the same brush. But then, yer honour, we has our grievances; and I hopes it ull be no offence, yer honour, if I axes leave to speak out plainly a bit o’ my mind in regard o’ myself and my shipmates.” Yorick shouted, “Go on, my man!”—”Well, then, yer honour,” continued Will, whilst breathless silence pervaded the group of tars,—”Well, then, yer honour, it’s just as this here—and I knows the posterior I places myself in by shoving myself forud,—I’m saying, yer honour, it’s just as this here: we tries to do our dooty to the best of our ‘billity—and nobody can do more;—we obeys orders whatsomever they may be, and in course, as a nat’ral con- sequence, we don’t like ill usage: and, both God A’mighty and the devil knows, we have had a double allowance o’ that sarved out to us lately by Muster——.”</p>

<p>The officer, whose name had been uttered, eyed the speaker with proud disdain—his face reddened with anger, and he was about to interrupt the seaman in strong language, when Captain Yorick turned to him and said,
“Wait, sir; you shall have an opportunity—let us first hear what these mutinous rascals have to say.”</p>

<p>“I am no mutinous rascal, Captain Yorick,” responded Will Scott respectfully; “yer honour knows that ‘rascal’ don’t belong to me. I stand here to claim—ay, to demand—my rights, and the rights of my shipmates, who have been suffering injury and oppression. I am doing that which yer honour would do, if, instead of being captain of this here frigate, you wore a blue jacket among the rest.” Yorick felt this, for he was aware that there were many things in the service that required amendment and redress, and he himself had vainly endeavoured to induce the Admiralty to better the condition of the seamen. “Well, then, in course, yer honour, we wants to square the yards o’ conscience by the lifts and braces of honesty; we wants better treatment from the officers—our full allowance of grub—the requests of the fleet complied with, and damni- fication for all chafes and rubs by the way; and, with all due honour and respect, we begs that you will send Muster —— out of the ship, in company with the boasun.”</p>

<p>“Never!” shouted Yorick in a determined “If they have done you wrong, there are laws by which they may be tried. But do you think I would yield to intimidation—do you think I would punish an officer without a trial? I dare not do it—I will not do it; and if you persevere in your mutinous designs, I will leave you to your fate.”</p>

<p>“Captain Yorick,” said the seaman solemnly, “we have rove the yard-rope for them as misbehaves;” and he pointed to the fore-yard-arm. “We should be all sorry for you to leave us: ounly say that you will remain aboard, and every soul fore and aft shall obey orders or suffer for it. Grant our requests, and—”</p>

<p>“Out of your own mouth will I judge you, my man,” returned Yorick, rather impatiently interrupting him. “You have rove a yard-rope to preserve discipline—thereby showing the impossibility of carrying on the war without it: how, then, can your officers expect to keep the people in order but by strictness and attention?”</p>

<p>But not cruelty, yer honour,” responded Will; “and that’s the thing as we complains on. Howsomever, we are detarmined to stand by one another—meaning no disparagement to yer honour, who, we hopes, will keep command of the ship.”</p>

<p>“Not an hour—not a minute longer than I find you remain obedient to your officers,” returned Yorick. ” You fancy that this mutiny is raised by upright minds who have your good in view. No such thing—it is your enemies that have urged it on! Look at your country battling the watch with a nation that ardently longs for the dominion of the seas:—will you then madly desert your duty,—will you see the ensign union downwards and yet abandon the vessel in distress? What injures your country must injure you; and if the craft is to sink through your folly, why then, by—, you will all go to together!”</p>

<p>“We are ready to meet the enemy, yer honour,” said Will Scott; “clap us alongside, and they shall find we arn’t forgot how to put wad to our shot and ram home with a rally. All we wants is our due. Speak, men,” shouted he, turning to the ship’s company, “arn’t you ready to stand by your guns?”—” Yes, yes—ay, ay!” “We loves our country, and likes our captain, but no tyrants!” ” No tyrants!”—Such were the responses; but the latter swelled into one general chorus loud and long.</p>

<p>“I will give you ten minutes to consider what you will do,” exclaimed Yorick; “and upon your decision depends whether I retain my command or not. Consult amongst yourselves, and remember I am not to be trifled with!” He then went below to his cabin; and though only absent exactly ten minutes to a moment, on his return to the quarter-deck he ascertained that the whole of the officers had been decoyed before the gangways, and prevented from coming aft; and the obnoxious lieutenant had been forced into the jolly-boat, and was then half-way towards South-sea beach. “You have decided, men!” shouted he; “not another word. Call that shore-boat alongside: I will never command a set of mutineers!” and in a few minutes afterwards he quitted the frigate.</p>

<p>It is no part of my intention to carry the history of the mutiny further. At its suppression Captain Yorick again took command of Le Cerf, and in 1800 was removed into the Jason, a frigate of a larger class,—the same warm-hearted but strict disciplinarian he ever was. The gunner had followed him; and the once little Parker, now a fine young man, had through the interest of his chief mounted the white lapels, and bade fair to become an ornament to the service.</p>

<p>General Edmonds and the corporal continued to chalk their way through life without a shadow of a change, except that they were more busily engaged in the model-room (at the Rumble-tumble), which had been entirely rebuilt on a new principle, on account of a <i>trifling</i> accident which had happened to the origi- nal whilst testing the charges of some newly-invented rockets, which <i>inadvertently</i> exploded and pitched the roof into the lake, laid pro- strate the walls and multiplied the models in an astonishing degree. Their schemes, however, had now become so numerous, and the general was so constantly on the hatch, that Singleton was compelled to have his pockets considerably enlarged, for the purpose of stowing away embryo patents—self-acting mortars—improv- ed field pieces—pontoons,—in short, “a little of everything in the combustible way,” as the corporal observed, including a new apparatus for boring cannon.</p>

<p>Captain Edmonds—or rather Major Edmonds, for to that rank had he been advanced—was still in the East, earning fame and wealth with his gallant colonel, who gave pro- mise of that excellence in the field which sub- sequently raised him to a dukedom.</p>

<p>The Misses Wentworth were still in single blessedness, and Amelia never ceased to cherish the warmest affection for her soldier-cousin. Offers had been made, suitors had proposed; but she resisted every overture, devoting her existence to the object of her regard. Very little intercourse had taken place between the general and his lordship since the assassin-like attempt upon Ten-thousand; indeed, Aunt Alicia, whose temper became more violent and arbitrary as she increased in years, had effec- tually prevented every manifestation of re- maining friendship. Miss Waldegrave had grown into full-blown beauty, and, like Amelia, undeviatingly adhered to the vows she had pledged to our hero: although for some considerable time she had received no communication from his hands, yet so satisfied was she of his integrity, that she rightly attributed it to its true cause,—the surreptitious detention of her letters by the Honourable Lieutenant Wentworth, who, making sure of her fortune as well as her person, paid but little attention to his expected future bride; though his gallantry (if it may be so misnomered) in other quarters was no very profound secret.</p>

<p>Mr. Hector retained his sacred office as a humble curate, and had substantial occasions to remember the christening of our hero both from the young lieutenant and his worthy patron the gunner. Mrs. Hector was still the same kind, affectionate, and Christian-like partner—treading in the path that leads to everlasting happiness hereafter. Mr. Brief perseveringly devoted himself to his professional avocations, and unremitting in his endeavours to ascertain some clue to the origin of Ten-thousand’s being deserted in so helpless and cruel a manner. Only one incident had occurred; and this took place shortly after the affair in the metropolis, when Wentworth used his knife upon young Blocks.</p>

<p>The little lawyer was sitting in his office one morning at his characteristic occupation, making the most of his time, when a lady was announced, and a female well dressed in deep mourning was ushered into the room: she was of a commanding figure, and still retained evidences of great early loveliness, which appeared to have been prematurely withered by discordant passions. Now, Lawyer Brief was a confirmed bachelor as far as it regarded family matters, though one of the most constant and attentive husbands to his business, for he was wedded to his profession, and the fruits of the union were extremely productive. Still, he was rather shy of lady clients, particularly lady clients in widow’s weeds, for he generally found that, from having been over-indulged by the dear good man defunct, they were self-willed and difficult to manage; or, on the other hand, if their mourning was mere outward show and the heart rejoiced at being emancipated from tyrannic control, they determined to make the utmost of their liberty by insisting upon having their own way in everything, and both imagined that the law, and not unfrequently even justice, ought to be swayed and guided according to their own peculiar views and wishes.</p>

<p>The handsome woman now before him was arrayed in the usual symbols of widowhood, that set her off to great advantage, and her look was that of one who seemed far more calculated to enforce obedience than to follow advice. The little lawyer took a rapid personal inspection through his glasses as she approached towards him; and then, throwing his spectacles upon his forehead in a sort of intellectual manner he arose, and politely handed the lady a chair. This was the first time for many years he had stooped to such condescension, and the clerk was struck with astonish- ment at seeing his office thus taken out of his hands by a <i>coup de main</i>;—indeed, the little man himself seemed so surprised and embarrassed by such a prompt act of gallantry, that, after seconding it by an ungracious bow, he hastily retreated to his high stool, and having laid his arms upon the table, he firmly rested his main body upon them, as if posting himself in a favourable position to concentrate his forces and resist all further attacks.</p>

<p>“Your name, sir, is Brief,” said the lady in a voice of musical sweetness. The ungracious lawyer nodded. “You advertised, some years ago—” and she sighed so heavily, that something, which to those who did not thoroughly understand him might have been taken for a sympathetic response, issued from the solicitor; but it was only a sort of grunt to which he had habituated himself when displeased: indeed, sighing with him was out of the question: he used to say that “he never could discover how people sighed—it was making a pair of bellows of the heart.” But the fact was, some twenty or thirty summers back, Lawyer Brief did entertain a desire to take unto himself a wife; yet, not having sufficient leisure to look for a female suited to his purpose, and still less time to spare in courtship, he boldly advertised for the precious commodity; and the applications were so numerous, and the characters of the parties so diversified, that he was very nearly driven mad, and being unable to come to any decision, he abandoned the scheme in utter despair of ever succeeding to his mind. This it was that elicited the aforesaid grunt when the lady opened the campaign with “You advertised, some years ago—” for the man of the law beheld not only in his imagination, but also in corporeal substance before him, an applicant who was by no means unlikely to assault and carry him by storm. The lady, however, seemed rather pleased than otherwise by the demonstration, for most probably she deceived herself into a belief that it was an utterance of commiseration, and she again commenced, “You advertised, some years ago——”</p>

<p>“I did, madam,” replied the lawyer, interrupting her, for he thought it more wise at once to prevent her from advancing her position than to have the unpleasant and, in all probability, difficult task of beating her back again from her ‘vantage ground,—”I did, madam,” said he; “and if your only business here relates solely to that unfortunate advertisement, I may as well cut short our interview by telling you that further trouble is needless.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, I suppose it has terminated fortunately,” said the lady, by no means abashed by the repulsive behaviour of the solicitor. “It was a strange affair apparently, and you must be happy that you have found——”</p>

<p>“No, madam,” returned the lawyer impatiently, rising from his stool, “I have not found—I never shall find,—d——n me! I never <i>will</i> find——”</p>
    
<p>“Then the advertisement must still be in full force,” returned the lady placidly, as if she had some object to gain. “I thought the foundling——”</p>

<p>“The what, madam?” interrupted the lawyer, as he again seated himself at the table and took up his former position of defence.</p>

<p>“The foundling, sir,” answered the lady. “You advertised, some years ago, relative to a foundling, I believe; and that advertisement has been repeated at subsequent intervals. Am I not correct?”</p>

<p>Brief breathed freely again. He had been premature in his conclusions; but now at once shaking off all embarrassment when he found it was a mere matter of business, and not of matrimony, he answered in the affirmative. “Beg pardon: little mistake—you are correct.”</p>
Page 127

<p>“Well, then, sir, I am induced to suppose you are able to inform me of the particulars of that event,” said the lady. Brief nodded his assent, and a look of reproach seemed to pass across the widow’s features. “Some of the child’s apparel is in your possession,” continued the lady; and again the lawyer nodded, for he made it a maxim never to throw away even a monosyllable unnecessarily. “Pray, may I be permitted to see it?” inquired the widow.</p>

<p>The lawyer bowed acquiescence; and drawing down his spectacles to their proper <i>hunting</i> position, he added, “Favour me, madam,—your name, if you please?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly,” replied the lady, with a winning look that might have warmed an iceberg. “My name is Sinclair—Lady Hortensia Sinclair, the widow of the deceased Lieutenant- general Sinclair;” and she looked proudly and keenly at the lawyer to ascertain what effect the announcement would produce upon him.</p>

<p>Mr. Brief was certainly not unmoved at the manner and title of his visitor; but the movement was merely to dip his pen in the ink; and, in a stiff, cramped hand, he wrote what looked very much like bits of burnt straw strewed over the paper: it was the date and the lady’s name, which, having accomplished, he uttered, “Proceed.”</p>

<p>Apparently mortified that she had made no sensible impression on the lawyer’s heart, the lady frowned, but it instantly vanished again. “Do you require my lineage—my birth and parentage?” said she.</p>

<p>“Use your own pleasure, my lady,” returned the man of the law with a complacency of demeanour that pleased her.</p>

<p>“It is hardly requisite,” responded the smiling lady: “and as for residence, I have so recently arrived in England, that I have not yet had time to settle my place of habitation. Circumstances that it is not at present necessary to recapitulate have induced me to entertain strong conjectures that the infant who was so inhumanly deserted,—in fact, the dress will most probably inform me whether the foundling is or is not a near relation of mine, now, no more. If it should be so, I shall, as a matter of course, relate every particular to you; and if not, I shall be spared the pain of entering upon the subject.”</p>

<p>At this moment the clerk entered and handed over a slip of paper to his principal, who having perused its purport, hastily wrote some lines beneath those he had read, and returned it: the subordinate then left the room. “I can have no objection to show you the things, my lady,” said Lawyer Brief,—”anything that can tend to elucidate the mystery is certainly most desirable; and happy shall I be if my young client can honourably claim such respectable alliance.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir, answered the lady, “I fear the term honourable, according to the general acceptation of the term in such matters, cannot be applied to his origin; but if I find my conjectures are right, the youth shall not want a friend.”</p>

<p>“It appears, my lady, that you are aware of his existence,” said the lawyer, as if making a mere casual observation.</p>

<p>The lady looked confused, but promptly replied, “I am aware of it, Mr. Brief,—nay, more, I have seen him; and I confess the likeness to those who are gone first struck me even before I knew a word of his story. But that also was repeated to me by a young friend of my late husband’s—Captain Edmonds. So that all I am desirous of doing is to examine the articles of dress, to ascertain whether they will afford any evidence to confirm my predisposition to belief. Are you satisfied?” And approaching the table, she spread a note of the Bank of England for ten pounds before the eyes of the lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Brief looked first at the lady, then at the note, and then at the lady again. “I <i>am</i> satisfied,” said he in a firm and decided tone; “you shall inspect the things.” He then opened a drawer of his table, and took out a pistol, which he laid upon his papers. “This is a precaution I always use, my lady, when I open my iron safe: it is best to be upon one’s guard, for there are lurking villains constantly on the watch for plunder, who would not hesitate to murder as well as rob if they expected an adequate booty.” He arose, took a bunch of keys from the same drawer, and proceeded to his iron depository, watched with the most eager and intense interest by the widow. The folding portals of the case were thrown open, and the bundle containing the dress in which young Blocks was discovered, as well as a succinct account of the occurrence, was brought forth and cautiously displayed. The shirt, the necklace, and the ring underwent a rigid scrutiny, and especially the latter: the lady’s hand trembled whilst she held it, and the three articles were clutched fast in her left hand, when suddenly snatching up the pistol and presenting the muzzle at the lawyer, she retreated towards the door.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said the cool propounder of the statues as he interposed to stop her progress.</p> 

<p>“Let me pass,” exclaimed the widow with vehemence, “or you are a dead man this instant!—Let me pass, man, or I‘11 fire!”</p>

<p>“Allow me to load the pistol first, my lady,” uttered Brief with a sarcastic tone. “Here, Saunders!” he shouted, and a scuffling in the passage ensued as if some contest was being carried on close to the door amidst oaths and execrations. “Have the goodness to deposit those things you have seized upon the table, Lady Sinclair,—if such is your title, which we shall see presently. You really had better comply, or to gaol you shall go for an attempt at robbery.”</p>

<p>The widow obeyed,—she laid the articles down; Brief bundled them up together, and the three-fold bolts of his iron safe soon had them in safe keeping: but he had scarcely turned the key, when the office-door was burst open, and in flew Joe Breeze and Saunders contending with two powerful men. Neither the lawyer nor his clerk were equal to one of the hostile party; in fact, he was too much for both of them together, and they speedily measured their lengths upon the floor. Old Joe battled the watch stoutly against his opponents, who, fearful that the noise would bring fresh assistance, followed the widow in her hasty departure from the premises. Joe Breeze (as he himself described it) topped his boom and made sail in chase; but they’d got the long start of him, and when he reached the door leading into the street, it was shut to with violence and locked on the outside, so as to make them all three prisoners.</p>

<p>Who they were, or what their motive could be, remained a mystery: they were foiled in their effort, and, as Brief declared, “took nothing by their motion.” He had, in fact, suspected from the first, and the slip of paper handed to him by Saunders informing him that two stout men were in the outer office in a great degree confirmed his suspicions: he wrote in reply, “Send for assistance,” and the clerk had endeavoured to obtain it: in fact, three or four constables arrived in a few minutes after the escape of the party, who liberated the trio from confinement. Old Joe had dropped in merely by accident, and thus became engaged in the affray.</p>

<p>But now a word or two of Joe Breeze and his worthy consort (as he called her). They had been constantly talking of shifting their berth, and yet remained as fast moored as ever. Joe had become a truly wealthy man—could calculate his thousands, and even his ten-thousands, in the funds, whilst his estates accumulated by several admirable purchases both in number and value;—in fact, he was himself, though only landlord of the Roaring Boreas, enabled to send no less than three <i>representatives</i> to the legislative body of the nation. Nightly was the subject discussed between them of retiring from <i>public</i> life to one of their snug cosey places in the country: they seldom went to bed without expressing a determination to make a change on the succeeding day; but the following morning found them as busy as ever,—Mrs. Breeze in her bar regarding all around her with pleased animation, and Muster Breeze blowing his cloud and spinning a yarn with his old ship- mates and messmates—discussing the manage- ment of the fleet and the governing of the nation.</p>
    
<p>The battle of the Nile was fought—the conquerors and their prizes returned to England,—and the Roaring Boreas was chock- full of the victors from morning till night. Then did honest Joe luxuriate, then were the tables marked with more plans of the fight than ever charts could be found in the hydro- graphical office; then were anchors let go—ships brought up by the stern with springs upon the cable;—in short, the action was fought over again in five hundred different ways, and frequently amid as much smoke as obscured the actual contest.</p>

<p>Only very little more than a twelvemonth had elapsed since the mutiny, and two great and important victories had been gained—Camperdown and the Nile. Here, then, was proof positive that British tars would nobly sustain the pre-eminence of their country’s flag. But this was not considered sufficient:—at a meeting held in the great room at the Roaring Boreas, an address of congratulation to his Majesty was proposed; an address that, whilst it rejoiced in the splendid achievements of the navy, was also to express the warmest attachment to his Majesty’s royal person: and who so able to get it drawn up and to present it to the sovereign as the veteran Joe Breeze himself? The thing was determined on— Joe’s consent obtained—a rough draft of the address was drawn up by the worthy landlord, and carried to Lawyer Brief to be polished.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that the document itself cannot be given: it was certainly a most characteristic affair, and the lawyer, knowing the humour of the Sovereign and the feelings of the honest tars, took especial care whilst polishing that none of its originality should be lost.</p>

<p>The affair got wind; the address was signed by thousands—even officers felt gratified at signing their names to the record; and Joe at length, having been plentifully supplied with clean shirts, hose, and nightcaps, made sail, in a chaise-and-four, decorated with blue ribands and a small union-jack in the bows, for the metropolis, and furnished with a letter of introduction from the Port Admiral to one of the Lords of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Various were the conjectures and rumours as he proceeded along the road. The editors of the provincial papers, having nothing but their own conjectures to rest upon, (for Joe was by no means communicative,) were in ecstasies, for they could make just what they pleased of it. Some announced fresh victories—others a rattling mutiny,—several thought there was peace; whilst all agreed there must be something. The paragraphs were duly copied into the London papers, and in a few hours the whole kingdom was as wise as the provincial editors themselves.</p>

<p>Honest Joe pushed on his way: he loved quick sailing, and his presents to the post-boys ensured speedy travelling. “When they touched the tip, they also tipped the wink to one another; and the “All’s right, yer honour was an intimation well understood.</p>

<p>The veteran had formed a grand idea of London. It was in the forenoon when he arrived; and away dashed the vehicle over Westminster Bridge through the short street, and turning with swiftness to the right for the Admiralty. Nobody could conjecture what it meant; and yet everybody knew, or pretended to know (which amounts to nearly the same thing), all about it. “A battle had been fought—Boney had been taken prisoner,—Joe was the avant-courier—and the captive was to follow on a visit to his Majesty, and be kept in a cage like a parrot’s somewhere in Hyde Park.”</p>

<p>At the Admiralty the worthy veteran found the lord he had the letter for, who entered joyously into the spirit of the thing; and after a short conversation with Joe, his lordship mounted the vehicle, dressed out as it was, and accompanied the honest seaman to the Home Secretary of State, and rumour applied all her brazen trumpets to sound the occurrence. In fact, so many attempts had been made to seduce the seamen of the Royal Navy from their duty, and so many reports had been circulated to show that they were disaffected as well as discontented, that the present demonstration was viewed with much gratification by the members of his Majesty’s Government, and honest Joe found himself, without knowing why, a very important personage indeed.</p>

<p>The next day but one was a levee-day; and notwithstanding all Joe’s remonstrances, he was to be rigged out in a court dress, regulation sword, and bag for his hair. But then what was he to do with his pigtail, that hung down his back as low as his waist, and might, upon a pinch, have served for a jolly-boat’s mizen-mast? It was, however, arranged that it should be brought down inside the collar of his coat; and the bag hanging without would conceal that any such monstrosity as his enormous outrigger existed. All this was sadly against the veteran’s inclination, particularly the “casing his lower stanchions” in black silk tights, which he declared “was an onnat’ral thing to expect from a seaman.” But no persuasions could induce him to wear his neckerchief in any other way than loosely knotted round his neck; and he determined to display his silver chain and call. Some strong argumentative disputes took place between Joe and the person who had been recommended to show him the lions of the metropolis; but the veteran was obliged to yield, for fear of giving offence to the Sovereign he loved. </p>

<p>The auspicious period arrived, the Admiralty Lord’s carriage took him up, and together they set out to the levee, old Joe receiving instructions relative to his behaviour as they proceeded. Now, notwithstanding the veteran had allowed the barber to stow away his tail so as entirely to conceal it in the back ground, he nevertheless felt it a degradation to be deprived of so handsome an ornament, and being free from observation and restraint as the vehicle rolled rapidly along through the streets, he contrived to haul it out from durance, and, by a little manoeuvring, to place it in its natural position; so that a thick club, not much unlike the fag-end of a stream cable, was soon seen hang- ing between his shoulders, surmounted by the handsome silk bag which court fashion dictated as necessary to etiquette.</p>

<p>The levee was very crowded, and the worthy seaman’s set-out excited much pleasantry in the circle; but Joe had eyes and ears for scarcely anybody except his sovereign,—though he was somewhat relieved from his first embarrassment by observing near his royal master a tall spare gentleman, with, as Joe described him, “his nose a cock-bill.” This was none other than the Prime Minister of England, to whom the veteran had been introduced the day before, and whom he instantly recognised. The Port Admiral in his letter to the Lord of the Admiralty had stated the services rendered by Breeze at the general election; and a man who could command three members was not to be despised. At the Home Secretary’s they had seen Mr. Pitt, who warmly acknowledged the obligation, and proffered his friendship in return; so that Joe felt at his ease when he saw him again.</p>

<p>There were also two other persons by the side of the reigning monarch, each destined in succession to fill the throne of England: these were the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Clarence, the latter in a uniform the sight of which warmed the heart of the old mariner. Now his Royal Highness instantaneously detected the nautical features of the veteran, and, approaching towards him, uttered a friendly hail that struck upon Joe’s tympanum like the “pipe to grog,” it was so joyous; and, to the astonishment of all present, he responded with a hearty What cheer, what cheer?” But just at this moment his turn came for presentation; and, without being at all daunted with the gorgeous spectacle, Joe boldly, though awkwardly, for his sword got between his legs and bothered him, advanced to the royal presence. In fact, the bearer of the seamen’s address was at that moment perfectly qualified, in his own estimation, for the important undertaking with which he had been entrusted: it was a point of imperative duty, and he set about it as he would any especial employ on board the ship he loved to decorate, confident that he was fully able to perform it, and determined that the work should neither disgrace himself nor the barky to which he was attached.</p>

<p>“May it please your Majesty, Mr. Breeze, of your Majesty’s Royal Navy, with an address from the seamen at Plymouth,” said the admiralty lord, displaying the old seaman in full fig.</p>

<p>“Breeze—Breeze?” said the King, giving Joe one of his peculiarly shrewd looks; “what ship, eh? what ship?”</p>

<p>“The Roaring Boreas, an’t please yer Majesty’s honour,” responded Joe laughingly, and giving first a knowing twist to his <i>club</i> tail, and secondly, a characteristic hitch to his silk tights.</p>
    
<p>What? what?” uttered the King,—”Roaring what?—Oh, ay,—Boreas—Boreas,—a Breeze in the Roaring Boreas, eh? What rank, what rank? steady Breeze, I hope, but what rank?” when observing the silver chain and call round the veteran’s neck, he added, “Oh, I see, I see—boatswain, eh? boatswain—Boatswain Breeze;—handsome call—<i>blow</i> it well, Mr. Breeze, eh?” and the good-humoured monarch laughed.</p>

<p>“God bless yer honour’s Majesty!” answered Joe, touching the forelock of his silvery hair, and making a scrape with his foot and a bend with his head that threw his enormous tail over his shoulder, “I arn’t a boasun, seeing as I never had the honour of sporting a warrant whilst under the pennant; but I’ve sarved your Majesty man and boy five-and-forty years, and ud be ready to sarve yer Majesty again whensomever you should be pleased to ax me. Though, for the matter o’that, your Majesty, I strive to do my best even out of commission, as Billy Pitt there—I humbly axes his honour’s pardon—I means Muster Billy Pitt, can testify.”</p>

<p>“Good, good—very good!” said the easily-pleased monarch; “Mr. Breeze and Billy Pitt!—But—but—but the address—the address” Observing Joe was again about to speak, he added, “What—what?—stay—stay!—the ad- dress—read the address.”</p> 

<p>This Joe did with a very good grace, giving the words their proper emphasis, to the infinite delight and gratification of the good-tempered king, who had a strong regard for his navy, and of Mr. Pitt, who had in some measure apprised his Majesty of the veteran’s claims to consideration.</p>

<p>“The seamen of the fleet at Plymouth, eh?” said the King when the veteran had ceased reading the document; “and signed, too,—signed by—let me see—let me see——,”</p>

<p>“—Upwards of four thousand, an’t please yer Majesty,” responded Joe, again twitching his tail behind him,—”all hearty souls, and ready to fight the devil, if so be as he should hoist the tri-colour ensign.</p> 

<p>“Hush! hush!” returned the King; ” never, never call names. But tell them, Mr. Breeze,—tell the seamen I receive their congratulations with pleasure, and am gratified by their expressions of attachment:—it shall ever be my study to watch over and promote their welfare, as much as they have manifested a determination to defend their king and country.</p>

<p>This was uttered slowly, clearly, and with strong feeling that made a powerful impression upon old Joe, who, on his Majesty graciously extending his hand to him to kiss, grasped it with eager enthusiasm in his hard, horny fingers, and gave it an honest, cordial shake that tickled old George’s fancy mightily; and though he tried to look grave, yet it only rendered the scene more ludicrous, and for a few seconds all court etiquette was set at defiance.</p>

<p>“God A’mighty bless yer royal Majesty for the honour as you’ve done me in shaking hands with a poor humble tar! All I am and all I have is heartily at yer Majesty’s sarvice, except this here call, which was guv me by General Elliott arter the siege o’Giberalter, for man-handling them there French and Spaniards.”</p>

<p>In the excitement of his narration, which had induced him to throw himself into attitude, Joe’s tail had again, somehow or other, swung bodily over his shoulder, and looked like a swivel on the present. “Siege of Gibraltar, eh?” said the King,—”siege of Gibraltar;—grand tail—wonderful tail:—kneel down, Mr. Breeze;—eh, Pitt, eh?” The minister bowed with stiff formality. “There—kneel, kneel, kneel—kneel down, Mr. Breeze!—Joseph, isn’t it, eh?—isn’t it, Joe—Joseph, eh? Joseph Breeze, kneel down.”</p>

<p>The words “grand tail,” “wonderful tail,” Joe had promptly applied to his tale of Gibral- tar and the call, and it tended greatly to gratify the old tar’s self-love; but to kneel in his silk tights was another matter,—it amounted nearly to impossibility,—and the repeated commands of the Sovereign still urging him, he exclaimed, “Well, then, I’m——” the rest was stoppered, for the eye of his royal master was upon him, and he felt rebuked before he uttered the oath. “But it’s all in regard o’these here consarns, yer Majesty,” said he, somewhat abashed at the predicament in which he was placed. “They would brace me sharp up, though I knew it was going free before yer Majesty I should be; and now here I am worse off nor a marine in purser’s slops—hard up, jammed like Jackson! Howsomever, here goes for a bend, anyhow, as I hopes yer Majesty’s honour and glory is a-going to guv me a blessing:” and down he dropped upon both hands and knees, ultimately raising himself upon the latter, whilst the ripping of seams, the cracking of stitches, and the chattering of the main stuff itself, gave evident testimony that there was ” something rotten in the state of Denmark.</p>

<p>“The monarch having received a sword from the hands of an attendant, held it over the veteran’s head; and then applying the flat part pretty smartly to his shoulders, he uttered, “Arise, Sir Joseph Breeze; there, there, there—get up, man, get up—rise, rise; I’ve knighted you, and you are now Sir Joseph; get up, get up.” But seeing that the worthy tar, either from the accumulated weight of his new dignity, or the tightness of his new breeches, could not accomplish the task, the King caught hold of his arm: ” Come, come, come,” said he, “I‘11 assist you.”</p>

<p>At this moment, one of the lords in waiting, observing how his Majesty was engaged, hastened forward to relieve him from his burden; upon which Joe exclaimed with vehemence, “Hands off, you lubber!—do you think his Majesty can’t do it himself?” and making a powerful demonstration (for such it most certainly was), Sir Joseph Breeze was set upon his legs.</p> 

<p>“Now, now—go, go,” said the King; “tell the sailors—tell them not to mutiny again, but—but to be good lads and beat the French. </p>

<p>“Then I’m d——if I don’t eturned Joe, so overpowered by his emotions as to forget the anointed presence in which he stood.</p>
    
<p>“Mustn’t swear—never swear,” said his Majesty in a tone half reproof, half remonstrance: “Bible says, ‘Swear not at all;’ read, read the Bible. Go, now, go:” and turning to the admiralty lord who had introduced the veteran, he added, “Take, take, take him away. Never swear—bad habit swearing—meant honestly though;—large tail, monstrous tail. There, there—good-b’ye, sailor, good-b’ye!”</p>

<p>“God A’mighty bless yer Majesty!” responded Joe with a schoolboy expression of contrition on his countenance. “I owns to the slapsis lingo, and is heartily ashamed on it. He then added, with slow voice and with strong emotion, “Good-b’ye, my royal master! May you ride it out in the smooth waters of happiness here, with the port of heaven under your lee; and when you slips your cables, may you next be moored in the haven of eternal peace and blessedness!”</p>

<p>The prayer was from the heart—it was solemnly, fervently uttered; and many a deep though silent “Amen!” responded to the petition from that high and titled assembly. The veteran took his departure from the palace, and was invited to pass some time with his representatives; but he preferred a visit to some of his old shipmates at Greenwich Hospital, to whom he dispensed his bounty so as to afford a liberal increase to their creature-comforts: he also inspected several of the grand sights in the metropolis, and then returned to Plymouth. Nothing could exceed the joyous glee of the subscribers to the address when, in public meeting assembled, Joe gave them an account of his mission; and when he announced that he was no longer plain Mister, but Sir Joseph Breeze, Knight, the building quivered with enthusiastic cheers, and my Lady Breeze was in the very height of her glory. Joe, according to what he conceived but a fair distribution of prize property, would willingly have shared half his knighthood with Lawyer Brief; but the thing was impracticable, and so he was compelled to bear it all himself, with his “blushing honours thick about him.” Still, for a “royal knight” (for so Joe styled him-self) to remain landlord of a public-house seemed to be doing discredit to the favour of his sovereign, and the subject of removal was more strongly discussed than ever. Night after night the debate was renewed, till at last they actually left the business in the hands of a trusty agent, and started to take possession of a pretty little snug box in the country, a “one-horse shay,” and dignity in retirement. At their time of life, however, new associations were out of the question; they tried to form acquaintance with the neighbouring gentry, but the aristocracy by descent looked upon them with contempt—the middle classes eyed them with envy—and the lower orders, missing the usual concomitants of gentility, indulged themselves in ridicule. Two or three times the “one-horse shay” had capsized, which Joe attributed to being taken aback in sudden squalls, but, his spouse declared, was owing to his having pulled the wrong rein. The servants (in livery) were very different to the docile domestics at Plymouth; Joe sadly felt the loss of his old friends;—in short, the change was anything but satisfactory, and the expiration of a month found Sir Joseph re-established in the great room at the Roaring Boreas, and Lady Breeze once more officiating in her hand- some and comfortable bar, to the great delight of the honest tars, who prided themselves mightily on the veteran’s title, his call, and his pigtail. </p>

<p>Age and infirmity had compelled Captain Courtney to resign his command and take up his abode ashore; and our hero was appointed to a beautiful corvette, mounting twenty-two long eighteens, in which, according to the date of his commission, he found himself second-lieutenant: and, by a singular chain of circumstances, Parker shortly afterwards joined as his junior—for the captain, enjoying post rank, had three lieutenants and a complement of one hundred and eighty men. She was, in truth, a lovely craft, of exquisite symmetry and ad- mirable proportions—her tapering spars towering above one another in nearly a continuous line, and raking aft with graceful ease, her square yards that spread a broad clew to the breeze;—in short, she was just the creature to fascinate a seaman’s eye and delight his heart.</p>

<p>Captain Rogerson was precisely the sort of man to command such a handsome craft as his Majesty’s ship Tulip. He was extremely good-looking,—fine, noble countenance—curly hair—in fact, not much unlike Sir Sydney Smith in person,—a thorough seaman and an officer of undoubted bravery; yet, with all these excellent qualities, Captain Rogerson was the most perfect and finished dandy that ever came from the neat cut of a tailor’s sheers, or was hotpressed by his goose. Singularly compact in his own dress, he was studiously exact in his orders that the whole of his Tulips, both officers and men, should follow his example. Those who had whiskers trimmed them to a set pattern on the captain’s countenance; and every morning watch, at seven bells, the fashion of the day was announced from the quarter-deck by the rig in which the skipper appeared, exactly to the moment when the glass was turned, and the sonorous herald of time gave notice that Captain Rogerson expected to meet all his officers on the appointed station of honour. Nor was this a mere meeting of formality, for habit rendered it one of cordial greeting; and the commander conversed as familiarly with his youngest midshipman as he did with his senior lieutenant: nor were the warrant-officers slighted, for the gunner, boat-swain, and carpenter, were always expected to attend the “levee,” and constantly received a fair share of attention. No levity was allowed—indeed, the slightest approach to playfulness was instantly checked—the bounds of decorum were never passed,—or if now and then the peculiar watchfulness of the chief slumbered, and the junior department felt an inclination to sport the monkey, Captain Rogerson seemed to be possessed of an intuitive manner of restoring respect to himself and the sacred character of the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, however, that the fashions were at some periods strangely capricious. For instance, in a heavy gale of wind, when the green seas were tossing the craft about like an empty bottle well corked, the captain would appear in white kerseymere knee-breeches and silk-stockings, a full uniform gold-laced coat, and cocked-hat splendidly bound, with the glittering band three fingers broad; at other times, in fine weather, thick Flushing trousers, and a pea-jacket, with a hairy cap, would form the costume for the day: so that, in the first instance, had they been boarded by a stranger, he would naturally have supposed that they had put to sea from a ball-room in a hurry; and in the latter, that they had suddenly and unexpectedly run out of a storm without having had an opportunity for chan- ging their nor’-westers. The old master and the boatswain were exceptions: all the coaxing—all the teasing—all the threats of court-martials could not persuade them that “one rig worn’t as good as another; “and the mistakes and shifts they were constantly making were ludicrous in the extreme, especially when the captain took it into his head to appear in buckskin breeches and top-boots with spurs.</p>

<p>Such was the droll compound under whom our hero was now to sail: but both he and Parker had been accustomed to eccentricities in Yorick, though of a totally different character; and therefore, falling into the humour of their young chief, (for he was only three-and-twenty,) they were happy as messmates and friends. The seamen were all picked men; for Rogerson spared neither money nor exertions to obtain thorough tars, and being wealthy and of an influential family, his wishes were generally acceded to by the commander-in-chief. His own boat’s crew were perfect models; and perhaps England could not produce seven finer-looking fellows, not one of them except the coxswain being older than their commander, for whom they felt an enthusiastic devotion bordering upon worship. Variable as Rogerson was in his own habiliments, he was still more so in the costume of his boat’s crew: they had all colours; and it was not unusual, when half-way between the ship and the shore, to make an entire cast of their clothing, and show off in something new. When the humour prevailed, they were dressed in tiger-skins, the oars were laid in, and short paddles substituted, which were used in the same manner as Indians in a canoe; but his favourite suit was one that as nearly as possible corresponded with the flower after which the corvette was named, and each of them had an imitation tulip reversed for a cap, with a long stalk sticking out at top.</p>

<p>For these and other humours, some of the old captains looked upon him with contempt; whilst many who affected to despise, still made attempts to copy the example, and that which was really natural in Rogerson became superlatively ridiculous in his imitators. His education had been strictly nautical—he loved the sea; but Nature had been bountiful to him in all her gifts—his memory was excellent, and he had stored his mind with the choicest readings from the best authors, and, when he chose, his conversation was brilliant and delightful. As he was afloat, so he was ashore: if he rode in a close carriage, he constantly drove four horses; but instead of these animals being two abreast, he would have them placed one before the other, that they might, as Jack said, “sail ship-shape, and not like sodgers a-marching.” This would have been a difficult and hazardous arrangement; but he had cautiously put his boat’s crew in regular training, and each mounted a horse, so that he had no less than four postilions. Tandem-driving, however, was his favourite amusement; and not unfrequently he would have three horses in a line, with a man on each side of the fore horse’s head, “to flatter in forud when they luffed up into the wind, or wouldn’t answer the helm.”</p>

<p>Captain Rogerson gave splendid dinners; when in port and at sea, his table always presented some delicacy or other, with the best wines that could be procured: he was generous to a fault, and, independent of the strictness with which he preserved discipline, was humane. In his punishments, however, he was extremely severe: but it was seldom that he had occasion, except now and then on a Sunday, to read any of the articles of war, and the cats with their numerous tails quietly slumbered in the boatswain’s store-room.</p>

<p>The ship was all a-taunto at Spithead waiting for orders, when Captain Rogerson, walking the quarter-deck with his second lieutenant, thus addressed him: “Were you ever—aw—upon the Wight—aw?—beautiful place—delightful ride. Should you—aw—like—aw—to join me in a trip?”</p>

<p>“It will afford me great pleasure, sir,” returned our hero, bowing. “I have landed on the island, but was never in the interior; though I have heard its scenery and fertility much praised.”</p>

<p>“You—aw—shall have ocular demonstration, Mr. Courtney,” returned Rogerson stiffly. “Mr. Parker!—aw—aw—have the goodness—aw—to man my boat.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” returned Parker, as he turned to issue the necessary order to the midshipman, who called to the boatswain’s mate, who chirped upon his call and shouted, “Tulips, away!”</p>

<p>In less than two minutes the boat was alongside, and before five minutes had expired,—the men in sea-green frocks and trousers—the officers in undress uniform,—had shoved off from the ship: the wind was fair—the sail was hoisted, and away they bounded over the waters like a bird upon the wing. At Ryde they procured horses, and were soon in the midst of green fields and ripening grain, for it was the very height of summer; and Ten-thousand enjoyed all those delicious sensations which had been so precious and delightful to him in the days of his boyhood. Nor was Rogerson backward in acknowledging the influence and power of Nature: his language became divested of the ordinary foppery—he was animated, entertaining, and manifested a knowledge of the picturesque which our hero would not without evidence have given him credit for. At Newport they “hove-to” for a short time, and then pursued their way across the island.</p>

<p>Ten-thousand imagined they had landed for the pleasure of a ride; yet affection reminded him that somewhere in the neighbourhood they should probably visit, stood the place in which Miss Waldegrave had passed the years of infancy, and he felt a strong desire to visit it; but he would not press his own gratification upon his commander, nor would he mention it at all, lest, being unwilling to enter into particulars, he should subsequently be discovered, and his conduct be liable to suspicion for duplicity. He had on several occasions heard from Caroline, whose attachment appeared by her letters to remain unchanged, and he had written in reply; but, as has been before stated, his correspondence was intercepted, and, much as an interview was ardently desired, she had requested him not to come to Devonshire till he received further directions from herself.</p>

<p>The two officers at length put up their horses at a village ale-house, and walked down to the romantic bay that forms one of the lions of the Isle of Wight, and which was, in fact, the one containing the solitary residence of the anchorite. Caroline had well described the spot to Ten-thousand, and his vivid fancy immediately recalled the scenery to mind, so that he had no doubt upon the subject. The dwelling of the recluse had also been minutely delineated in a drawing which our hero had copied, and his eye readily discovered the exact spot. He proposed ascending the craggy steps; but Rogerson excused himself, at the same time requesting his lieutenant to follow the bent of his inclination, and he would rejoin him in about an hour’s time.</p>

<p>The earnest wish to hear some intelligence of the Wentworth family overcame every other feeling, and Ten-thousand was soon on the flat in front of the cavern, whilst his captain strolled carelessly away and was shortly concealed from view. A few gentle knocks at the door brought out the recluse; and our hero, after suitable apologies, frankly told the object of his visit. The aged anchorite listened with earnest attention, and after a moderate lecture on the vanity and frailty of human endearments, he questioned Ten-thousand as to his present condition as well as his future prospects, and met with the most unreserved and candid answers,—in fact, the young seaman narrated particulars from the hour of his being saved by the worthy coxswain of the Alfred’s barge.</p>

<p>Varied emotions agitated the anchorite as the tale proceeded, and at its close the venerable man congratulated his companion on the success he had experienced; but he was by no means communicative of information relative to the only object that engrossed the young man’s thoughts,—and though he did not actually condemn the attachment, yet he certainly discouraged it as teeming with misery to both. The lieutenant talked of his expectancies from Captain Courtney, whose wealth was ample, and also of his determination to use his best endeavours to rise in the service so as to place Miss Waldegrave, should her fortune be sacrificed, in that station of society she was so well adapted to fill.</p>

<p>There was an eloquence in his language, and a plain, honest sincerity in his ardour, that could not fail to make a suitable impression on the individual whom he addressed. The recluse, however, combated his arguments with subtlety—closely interrogated him on many points which showed that he already possessed some knowledge of their mutual regard, and then informed him that the Wentworth family, including Caroline, were at that moment stopping at the cottage for a few summer weeks, having arrived from Devonshire two or three days before. Contrary to the persuasions of the recluse, our hero determined to proceed towards the grounds, under the hope of obtaining at least a sight of her whom he so affectionately loved, and, if possible, of enjoying an interview.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant descended the cliff, and was rapidly traversing the beach, entirely oblivious as it respected his commander, when suddenly turning the angle of a projecting rock, he beheld him at no great distance, in company with a female. An indescribable sensation crossed our hero’s mind, a sort of presentiment of evil; and as they evidently had not seen him, he again stepped back into concealment. Rogerson and his fair companion advanced; they were in unreserved conversation. Ten-thousand could clearly distinguish their voices, and that of the lady resembled one that was well remembered as having so delightfully thrilled upon his heart in happier moments: he peeped forth from his covert,—he could not be deceived—the female leaning on the captain’s arm was none other than Miss Waldegrave.</p>

<p>Oh, who can paint the racking, excruciating agony of the lieutenant’s mind!—the ardent expectation he had so fervidly cherished was at once crushed and destroyed, and he took in at one hasty glance the certainty of misery where he had anticipated happiness. He had been delighted with his ship, and satisfied with his captain; yet he made no doubt that the latter was his rival, and that it would of course be necessary for him to quit the former. He also felt the awkwardness of his present position; for if he showed himself from among the rocks, it would be directly supposed that he had been watching them. He therefore retired as noiselessly as possible to a still greater distance; though he could not avoid hearing what they said as they passed onwards within a few paces of him towards the anchorite’s cave.</p>

<p>“Nay, Adolphus,” uttered Caroline with emphasis, “you charge me unjustly: I have never ceased to value and esteem you as——” here the words became inaudible through the noise of the broken water on the shore.</p>

“Then go with me to Spithead,” responded Rogerson: “his lordship can make no objections. Prove that I am still the same to you! Miss Wentworth will bear you company; and—aw—if not, what prevents your coming alone to——”

<p>Ten-thousand heard no more; but quite enough had come to his ears to make him superlatively wretched. “Could the captain have been acquainted with his engagement to Caroline, or was the rencontre merely accidental?” were questions he repeatedly asked himself without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion. Not a single hint had passed between them that either was friendly with, or even knew the Wentworths; but it would appear to our hero’s mind that his commander had a design in the course he had taken, though probably without being aware of his lieutenant’s regard for Miss Waldegrave. At all events, in one thing he could not be mistaken: the familiarity which evidently existed between the parties could only have one origin,—a mutual attachment. Yet how could he reconcile this idea with the assurances of unalterable esteem he had from time to time received under her own hand? and what was the Honourable Mr. Wentworth about, to permit a favoured lover to enjoy the society of his future bride? All was mystery, and the blow had come so heavily, so unexpectedly—even at the very instant when his heart was overflowing with tenderness and hope, that it crushed his reasoning faculties, and he saw nothing but the dark side of the picture. He watched their receding forms; but they did not ascend to the habitation of the recluse, where, however, Ten-thousand promptly returned as soon as he could effect his purpose without observation. Unhesitatingly he communicated what had occurred to the anchorite, and, in the depth of his despair, would in all likelihood have committed some extravagance but for the soothing counsel of the aged man. He hastily wrote a few lines with his pencil on the blank leaf of his pocket-book, which he tore out and exhorted the hermit to deliver to Caroline. The recluse promised compliance, and gave the young man assurances that at length tranquillised his agony; so that by the time his captain’s hail was heard from the rocks below, he was calm: but his calmness proceeded more from the death of hope than from any return of a happy spirit.</p>

<p>On emerging from the cavern, the recluse endeavoured to cheer him with words of comfort; but Ten-thousand expected to find Miss Waldegrave still with his commander, and he struggled against the sickly sensations which threatened to overpower him. Nerving himself for the interview, he looked over the precipice and saw that Rogerson was alone. A wild hysterical laugh burst from him that rung with strange echoes amongst the cliffs, and bidding the recluse farewell, he descended to his superior, whose gaiety seemed more enlarged and animated as they returned across the island. A tumultuous excitement strained our hero’s faculties. Rogerson made no mention of the manner in which he had been engaged: Ten-thousand could not, and would not broach the subject; he therefore called all his energies into action, and talked and laughed immoderately; and the two officers, unrestrained by the discipline of the ship, gave full scope to their vivid imaginations in all the brilliancy of good education enlivened by sallies of wit and humour. The lieutenant laboured under a species of delirium something like that which is occasioned by swallowing laudanum, and he foolishly fancied that he had overcome his affection for Miss Waldegrave, and had relapsed into indifference. His captain was surprised and not a little gratified with the extent of his information, and the very gentlemanly manner in which he conducted himself: he knew him only as Edward Courtney, the son of one of England’s bravest chiefs,—for Ten-thousand’s history, although known to Parker, had not been communicated to any one in the corvette.</p>

<p>The boat was waiting for them at Ryde: Captain Rogerson returned to his old habits, and a respectful distance was rigidly exacted and as strictly observed. During their absence, a telegraphic despatch had come down, ordering the immediate departure of the Tulip for the Mediterranean; and the commander, after putting the lieutenant on board pulled over to Portsmouth to attend upon the admiral.</p>

<p>Parker instantly detected the alteration in the manner of his friend; there was an unusual redness of the eyes, and symptoms of petulance which were rapidly succeeded by unnatural attempts at mirth. The surgeon also observed it, and his professional knowledge speedily ascertained that the young man was in a high fever. With much difficulty he was persuaded to retire to his cabin, and a composing draught was administered; but it was long before over-wrought nature yielded to its power, and during the interval the agitation and distress of our hero were terrible,—he was perfectly sensible, and in the stillness of retirement his thoughts reverted to the events of the day. To endure such torment much longer seemed to be impossible, and he formed a determination to apply to be superseded,—to have one last interview with Miss Waldegrave, and then——but all the rest was blank.</p>

<p>At length he sank into a restless slumber, disturbed by harassing dreams, from which he awoke unrefreshed to find the ship under way and running through the Needles’ passage with a brisk breeze.</p>

		” Oh, Love ! how are thy precious, sweetest moments<br> Thus ever crossed, thus vexed with disappointment !”<br> Rowe.

<p>For a few days, Mrs. Hunter had persisted, although with very mysterious and significant looks, in refusing to satisfy the inquiries of her son as to the donor of the hundred pounds, by which his liberation from prison had been so quickly and so unexpectedly effected; but, being from her natural simplicity and openness very ill calculated for concealments of any sort, she at length suffered her secret to ooze out. Had it been any other person, she might have hesitated, but Alfred, she argued, was so particularly trustworthy, that she was
sure even Miss Owen herself would not object
to <i>his</i> knowing the whole affair, if it were
divulged to him in strict confidence.</p>

<p>Thus fully justified, as she thought, in
violating her promise, the good woman imparted to him the name of his benefactress,
enlarging upon the handsome manner in which
the boon had been conferred, as well as upon
its important effects in screening him from the
displeasure of Mr. Bryant, to whom his arrest
remained unknown.</p>

<p>” And now, my dear Alfred,” continued the
fond parent, ” now that I am disburthening my
bosom of its secrets, which I hate to keep
there, because they are just like so many birds
in a cage, fretting at their confinement, and
longing to pop out and effect their escape, I
must tell you of a discovery that I have made,
and which I dare say you will be not a little
surprised to hear.”</p>

<p>” I am all attention,” said the son, ” for I
see by your countenance that it is of pleasant
import, and to such tidings I am but seldom
called to listen.”</p>

<p>” No, indeed, my poor dear Alfred ! you
have nothing but annoyances and vexations to
endure, and most sincerely do I wish—la !
there’s a spot of ink upon the frill of your new
shirt ! I wish you wouldn’t hold your pen in
your mouth. Dear ! dear ! where <i>did</i> I put
my salt of lemons ? “</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> vexations and annoyances, dear mother,
are nothing, nothing whatever : I deserve them
all. It is your privations and the sorrows of
our dear pining Harriet that wring my heart,
and, as I sometimes fear, have irritated and
soured my temper.”</p>

<p>” Bless me, Alfred ! don’t talk in that distressing way. I have no privations ; I never
was so happy in my life—nothing in the
world to worry me, that is to say, just now, for there is no rent coming due these two
months ! Harriet will soon get over her low
spirits, poor girl ! and as to your temper,
every body says it is exactly like mine ; and
whatever may be my other faults, I know
myself to be so mild and gentle, that if any
body else were to call you ill-natured, I could
almost feel in my heart to scratch their eyes
out.”</p>

<p>” You have forgotten the secret that you
were about to impart to me.”</p>

<p>” Secret ! had I a secret ? well, I vow and
declare I <i>had</i> almost forgotten all about it.
Now, my dear Alfred, listen to me with all
your ears.” Here she drew her chair close
to that of her son, took his hand, and, looking in his face, with an expression of arch
and triumphant affection, continued—”Now
that I have disclosed to you the name of your
benefactress, tell me, can you or can you not
give a shrewd guess at her motive for the gift? “</p>

<p>” Assuredly I can. I presume her to have
been actuated by a natural benevolence.”</p>

<p>” A natural fiddlestick ! Pooh, pooh ! don’t
tell me. Generous she may be, but young
ladies seldom bestow such large sums upon
handsome and accomplished young men without—now don’t start and look angry, dear
Alfred ; you can’t deny that you <i>are</i> both handsome and accomplished—and young ladies, I
repeat, seldom make such liberal donations
without some feeling a <i>leetle</i> more warm and
tender than mere bountifulness of disposition.”</p>

<p>” Ridiculous ! this is the creation of your own
overweening fancy, and I must entreat that
you will never give utterance to a thought
which is alike painful to me, and disparaging
to Miss Owen.”</p>

<p>” Well, now, I call <i>that</i> ridiculous, if you
please. I don’t know why it should be painful to you, and I am sure it cannot be disparaging to Miss Owen. Your family is
better than her’s, though we are down in the
world at present. You are a gentleman born
and bred, and though—”</p>

<p>” Tush, madam ! for Heaven’s sake no more
of this. You forget that Miss Owen is an
heiress, and that I am degraded to a servile
situation. Pray let us change the subject.
Be assured that you have drawn a most erroneous conclusion from a single act of benevolence.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me, Alfred; I know better.
Ah ! you should have seen her when I told
her of your being arrested. She turned as
pale as ashes, and panted for breath, and
became so agitated, that I thought she would
have gone into hysterics. Was <i>that</i> a simple
feeling of charity ? No, no ; we women are
not so easily to be deceived in one another’s
emotions. Having been in love myself, I know
what it is—I remember, as well as if it were only yesterday, when your poor dear father,
who is now among the saints in heaven, was
paying me his addresses, and fell from his
horse, or rather the beast tumbled with him,
for he was an excellent horseman, a friend
called to tell me of the accident, and after
desiring me to arm myself with all my fortitude, exclaimed, in a solemn voice Look—! look ! Tabby has caught a mouse, I do declare !—nay, you shall not torment the poor creature.”</p>

<p>Up jumped the kind-hearted Mrs. Hunter,
and, after declaring that, although these little
pilferers were a sad plague to her, she could
not bear to see them worried to death, she
liberated the intended victim, which quickly
made its escape, consoled Tabby for the loss
by a lump of sugar, and was about to resume
her story, when her son, who had often heard
it before, assured her that her feelings upon
the interesting occasion, to which she had alluded, could not afford a faithful clue to those
of Miss Owen, and implored her once more
not to lend herself to a groundless delusion,
which must wear an appearance of the vainest
presumption, and the most inexcusable ingratitude, should it ever come to the knowledge of
their benefactress.</p>

<p>” Well, well,” said the mother, with a look
of significant obstinacy, ” I am very willing to
hold my tongue, but you cannot argue me out
of my opinion. I will not refer to the subject,
even in the remotest manner, since you desire
me not ; but, say what you will, I am confident,
and indeed I should wonder if it were otherwise, that a certain young lady who shall be
nameless is in love with a certain young gentleman who shall be equally nameless.”</p>

<p>” Gentleman ! ” exclaimed Alfred, smiling
in bitter spirit. ” Are you alluding to Jacob
Bryant’s Wharf-clerk? “</p>

<p>” I am alluding to one who, let him fill what situation he may, is every inch a gentleman,
though I say it that shouldn’t say it, and,
therefore, you must not be seen with this inkspot upon your frill. Ah ! I hope one of these
days to see you restored to the rank of a gentleman, and conducting yourself as such, and then
you will never, please God, have occasion to
touch these nasty pens. Come along with me,
and I will look for the salt of lemons. I
<i>do</i> think I must have put it in the little
drawer, under the beauffet, where I lock up
the silver teapot and spoons — don’t you, dear
Alfred ? “</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> do not take up notions without some
basis to support them,” replied the son, with
a faint smile ; ” therefore, I must be excused
from offering a guess on the subject.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the opinion he had thus
confidently expressed, Hunter’s demeanour
towards Helen, influenced by a heartfelt
gratitude for her recent generosity, unconsciously assumed a more tender and deferential character than
had hitherto been his wont.
Never had be appeared to her to display his
own talents to half so much advantage as when,
deriving an evident gratification from eliciting
her’s, he sate by her side, gazing upon her with
a look of respectful homage, asking her opinion
upon various points of literature and art, deferring to her judgment, not with a servile
acquiescence, but with the air of one who is
really grateful for being enlightened, or yielding himself heartily, when she indulged her
vivacious sallies, to the influence of her sportive
wit.</p>

<p>From any undue conceit Helen was as free
as most girls, but she had the foibles and
feelings of our common nature; and it was
hardly, therefore, to be expected that she
should be insensible to this most refined and
delicate of all flattery, coming from a man
of acknowledged talents, who had already made a much deeper impression upon her heart than
she herself suspected.</p>

<p>By the sedulity of his homage to Helen,
Hunter in the mean time had succeeded in persuading Rose, whatever she might have once
suspected to the contrary, that his admiration
and his regards were now diverted from herself
and exclusively engrossed by her friend. The
humility which is ever the concomitant of real
merit and genius prevented her from being in
the smallest degree surprised at this conviction,
although it could not entirely obviate the secret
pang by which it was accompanied. Not only
did it seem to her perfectly natural that the vivacity, accomplishments, and amiability, of her
friend should eclipse her own poor attractions,
fading away as they evidently were under the
withering influence of melancholy and ill health ;
but she clearly perceived and readily acknowledged that the attachment which, if directed
towards herself, scarcely admitted the possibility of any satisfactory result, became sanctioned,
when Helen was its object, by every consideration
of worldly prudence and discretion. Recollecting
the birth,education, and personal recommendations of Hunter, she saw nothing whatever in
his reduced circumstances that should deter
him from aspiring to the hand of Helen ; indeed, there were innumerable motives, both in
his own situation and in that of his family,
which must manifestly prompt him to desire the
alliance. In the firm persuasion that its accomplishment would secure the happiness of
two parties, to one of whom she owed a long
debt of gratitude, while her heart was not less
tenderly interested in the welfare of the other,
the generous girl determined to devote her
influence and good offices to the promotion of
their union.</p>

<p>With all the perseverance of high principle,
all the ardour of a generous and determined
self-sacrifice, she struggled against her feelings, her appearance every day exhibiting with greater
obviousness the ravages of the contest in which
she was engaged. It seemed as if this delicate
and fragile creature, who, even in her healthier
state, rather resembled a spirit than an inhabitant of earth, was now, indeed, about to assume an etherial form, and to pass away into
some new element better adapted to the purity
of her mind, and the transparent tenuity of her
frame.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunter, with all her simplicity, had a
maternal eye to the main chance where her son
was concerned ; and, as she retained her conviction of Helen’s prepossession, she failed not
to sing the praises of his domestic virtues, and
to extenuate the peccadilloes into which he
had been betrayed. Her regard for veracity,
however, would not allow her to conceal the
pecuniary difficulties in which he was perpetually involving them, an indiscretion which the
good lady condemned and vindicated in the same breath. They might be freed, as it appeared, from their present embarrassments by a
trifling sum, which Helen instantly resolved to
advance, though she hesitated to disclose her
purpose, and could not immediately decide upon
the mode of effecting it.</p>

<p>From a closer observation of Mrs. Hunter,
whose character, indeed, was almost as easy to
be read as a printed book, she not only doubted
her power to retain a secret, but began to apprehend that her own motives in the proposed donation were very likely to be misinterpreted. Had
she said <i>detected</i>,she would, perhaps, have used a
more appropriate term. Not choosing to subject herself to any such <i>injurious</i> suspicion;
and afraid that she might be discovered by her
hand-writing, should she transmit her gift in a
cover addressed by herself, she finally concluded, after due cogitation, to avail herself of
Rose’s agency, as the most effectual mode for
concealing the source of the gift. The venial falsehood of writing within the envelope : —
” From an old friend of Mrs. Hunter’s family,”
would probably direct the suspicions of that
lady into some other quarter, and, if they
were turned towards herself, it was easy,
with the help of a little casuistry, to deny
that she had either written or forwarded the
letter.</p>

<p>Having formed this resolution, she hastened
to Rose’s apartment, and, with a flush upon
her features, which seemed to confirm the anger
she had assumed, exclaimed, as she threw herself into a chair : —” Well ! I have no patience
whatever with this extravagant, thoughtless,
unfeeling Mr. Hunter. His conduct is really
abominable, and deserves to be exposed. Were
it the first, or even the second time, it might
be overlooked, but these reiterated indiscretions
are unpardonable, scandalous ! Surely he might
remember the claims of his family, even if he
chooses to forget what is due to himself.”</p>

<p>” Alas ! what new offence has he committed ?” demanded Rose eagerly, while her
wan features reddened with apprehension.</p>

<p>” The worst species of new offence—the repetition of an old one for which he has already
suffered. By his extravagance and misconduct,
he has once more exposed his affectionate
mother and amiable sister to embarrassments
of the most humiliating nature.”</p>

<p>” Ah, dear Helen ! is it not some extenuation of his fault that he was born to independence ? Nothing so difficult, especially for a
young man, as to discard expensive habits, and
suddenly practice a rigid thrift.”</p>

<p>” Ridiculous ! Sensible people will always
adapt themselves to their circumstances ; and
there are thousands who maintain themselves
and their families in decent comfort, upon a
much narrower income than that of Mr. Hunter.”</p>

<p>” Yes, but they have never known any better state. To them economy is no effort, because
it is no novelty; it has been the practice of
their whole life ; but to Mr. Hunter it is a new
and painful task, and one which it must be exceedingly difficult to perform when every recollection of the past tempts him to forget the
present”.</p>

<p>” At all events, Rose, it is an imperative
duty, and you will not surely excuse its non-performance, when it involves the peace and
respectability of a whole family. Oh ! I have
no patience with him ! especially as I have
good reason to suspect that his mother and
sister often deny themselves comforts, that
they may provide him little luxuries and indulgences. However, I came not hither to talk of
Mr. Hunter, indeed I care not how rarely his
name is mentioned, but to have a little chat
with you about the old lady, whose painful
condition I most sincerely commiserate, especially when I call to mind how trying and irksome it must be for one who has moved in a better sphere to be reduced in life, and obliged
to contend with all the hardships of comparative poverty.”</p>

<p>” You said, just now, that sensible people
would always adapt themselves to their circumstances.”</p>

<p>” I was speaking then of young men, to
whom the rough trials of life are a mere pastime, and who ought to conform themselves to
their station, however humble, without difficulty. With an elderly female the case is very
different. Mrs. Hunter, nevertheless, <i>is</i> reconciled to her lowly lot, and never seems to regret
it, except on the account of her undeserving son.
She is a most estimable person ; a kinder and
more single-hearted woman I never knew ; and
poor Harriet, whose depression of spirits I can
now well explain, is really a most intelligent
and amiable girl. I cannot bear to see such
deserving persons exposed to the annoyance of duns for a mere trifle ; and I was thinking,
therefore, my sweet little Rose de Meaux, of
sending them, anonymously, of course, a sufficient sum to extricate them from their immediate difficulties.”</p>

<p>” It was a thought worthy of yourself,” said
Rose, pressing her friend’s hand to her heart,
while she glowed with the pleasure that always
thrilled her whole sensitive frame at the mention of any generous deed.</p>

<p>” Nay,” resumed Helen, ” you mean it
would be utterly unworthy of me to act otherwise, the amount being so insignificant. I
need not add that the transaction must remain
a secret between you and me. From considerations of delicacy, I shall send the money
anonymously, and, as my hand-writing is
known to Mrs. Hunter, I wish you to direct
the <i>envelope,</i> lest the good lady should attribute my interference to improper motives.”</p>

<p>” To improper motives ! By what motives
can she—?”</p>

<p>” Psha ! I meant to say erroneous. One
would not wish—people are so apt—, misconstructions are very annoying — surely you
can understand my feelings.”</p>

<p>” I believe I do,” said Rose with a faint
smile ; ” and I will willingly lend my assistance to your benevolent views. It will be a
great relief to poor Mr. Hunter’s mind to find
that his family—.”</p>

<p>” Oh ! don’t mention <i>his</i> feelings ! he deserves to be punished, were it ten times as
much. Say no more about him, but come with
me to my room, and I will instruct you what
to write on the inside of the cover.”</p>

<p>Here the conversation ended for the present ;
but enough had been said to convince Rose
that, although Helen’s natural benevolence
might have prompted her to assist the mother
and daughter, her sympathies were much more deeply engaged for the son, in spite of
the increased acerbity with which she condemned what she now termed his profligate
courses.</p>
